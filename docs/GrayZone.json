  {"id":"abreu_bargainingreputation_2000","abstract":"The paper develops a reputation based theory of bargaining. The idea is to investigate and highlight the influence of bargaining ‘postures’ on bargaining outcomes. A complete information bargaining model a la Rubinstein is amended to accommodate ‘irrational types’ who are obstinate, and indeed for tractability assumed to be completely inflexible in their offers and demands. A strong ‘independence of procedures’ result is derived: after initial postures have been adopted, the bargaining outcome is independent of the fine details of the bargaining protocol so long as both players have the opportunity to make offers frequently. The latter analysis yields a unique continuous-time limit with a war of attrition structure. In the continuous-time game, equilibrium is unique, and entails delay, consequently inefficiency. The equilibrium outcome reflects the combined influence of the rates of time preference of the players and the ex ante probabilities of different irrational types. As the probability of irrationality goes to zero, delay and inefficiency disappear; furthermore, if there is a rich set of types for both agents, the limit equilibrium payoffs are inversely proportional to their rates of time preference.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Abreu","given":"Dilip"},{"family":"Gul","given":"Faruk"}],"container-title":"Econometrica","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/1468-0262.00094","ISSN":"1468-0262","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2000]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1468-0262.00094","page":"85-117","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Bargaining and Reputation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1468-0262.00094","volume":"68"},
  {"id":"acharya_warcrazytypes_2015","abstract":"This article introduces a model of war and peace in which leaders believe\n                        that their adversaries might be crazy types who always behave aggressively,\n                        regardless of whether it is strategically optimal to do so. In the model,\n                        two countries are involved in a dispute that can either end in a peaceful\n                        settlement or escalate into ‘limited war’ or ‘total war.’ If it is common\n                        knowledge that the leaders of the countries are strategically rational, then\n                        the only equilibrium outcome of the model is peace. Yet if a leader believes\n                        that there is a chance that her adversary is a crazy type, then even a\n                        strategically rational adversary may have an incentive to adopt a madman\n                        strategy in which he pretends to be crazy. This leads to limited war with\n                        positive probability, even when both leaders are strategically rational. The\n                        article shows that despite having two-sided incomplete information, the\n                        model has a generically unique equilibrium. Moreover, the model identifies\n                        two countervailing forces that drive equilibrium behavior: a reputation\n                        motive and a defense motive. When the prior probability that a leader is\n                        crazy decreases, the reputation motive promotes less aggressive behavior by\n                        that leader, while the defense motive pushes for more aggressive behavior.\n                        These two forces underlay several comparative statics results. For example,\n                        the study analyzes the effect of increasing the prior probability that a\n                        leader is crazy, and the effect of changing the relative military strengths\n                        of the countries, on the equilibrium behavior of both leaders. The analysis\n                        also characterizes the conditions under which the madman strategy is\n                        profitable (or not), which contributes to the debate in the literature about\n                        its effectiveness.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Acharya","given":"Avidit"},{"family":"Grillo","given":"Edoardo"}],"container-title":"Political Science Research and Methods","DOI":"10.1017/psrm.2014.23","ISSN":"2049-8470, 2049-8489","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,5]]},"language":"en","page":"281-307","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"War with Crazy Types","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-science-research-and-methods/article/abs/war-with-crazy-types/910C2B33FE9BAAB3E4D4B3BB0FDB5AE3","volume":"3"},
  {"id":"achen_rationaldeterrencetheory_1989","abstract":"Several recent books have argued that comparative case studies of crises demonstrate the failure of rational-deterrence theory; they have offered certain empirical generalizations as substitutes. This paper shows that such contentions are unwarranted. First, the empirical generalizations are impressive as historical insights, but they do not meet the standards for theory set out by the most sophisticated case-study analysts themselves. Second, the \"tests\" of rational deterrence used in the case studies violate standard principles of inference, and the ensuing procedures are so biased as to be useless. Rational deterrence, then, is a more successful theory than portrayed in this literature, and it remains the only intellectually powerful alternative available. Case studies are essential to theory building: more efficiently than any other methods, they find suitable variables, suggest middle-range generalizations for theory to explain, and provide the prior knowledge that statistical tests require. Their loose constraints on admissible propositions and suitable evidence are appropriate and even necessary for these tasks. These same characteristics, however, inevitably undermine all attempts to construe case-study generalizations as bodies of theory or tests of hypotheses.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,2,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Achen","given":"Christopher H."},{"family":"Snidal","given":"Duncan"}],"container-title":"World Politics","DOI":"10.2307/2010405","ISSN":"0043-8871","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[1989]]},"page":"143-169","source":"JSTOR","title":"Rational Deterrence Theory and Comparative Case Studies","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/2010405","volume":"41"},
  {"id":"acton_escalationentanglementhow_2018","abstract":"Nonnuclear weapons are increasingly able to threaten dual-use command, control,                     communication, and intelligence assets that are spaced based or distant from                     probable theaters of conflict. This form of “entanglement” between                     nuclear and nonnuclear capabilities creates the potential for Chinese or Russian                     nonnuclear strikes against the United States or U.S. strikes against either                     China or Russia to spark inadvertent nuclear escalation. Escalation pressures                     could be generated through crisis instability or through one of two newly                     identified mechanisms: “misinterpreted warning” or the                     “damage-limitation window.” The vulnerability of dual-use U.S.                     early-warning assets provides a concrete demonstration of the risks. These risks                     would be serious for two reasons. First, in a conventional conflict against the                     United States, China or Russia would have strong incentives to launch kinetic                     strikes on U.S. early-warning assets. Second, even limited strikes could                     undermine the United States' ability to monitor nuclear attacks by the                     adversary. Moreover, cyber interference with dual-use early-warning assets would                     create the additional danger of the target's misinterpreting cyber                     espionage as a destructive attack. Today, the only feasible starting point for                     efforts to reduce the escalation risks created by entanglement would be                     unilateral measures—in particular, organizational reform to ensure that                     those risks received adequate consideration in war planning, acquisition                     decisions, and crisis decisionmaking. Over the longer term, unilateral measures                     might pave the way for more challenging cooperative measures, such as agreed                     restrictions on threatening behavior.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Acton","given":"James M."}],"container-title":"International Security","container-title-short":"International Security","DOI":"10.1162/isec_a_00320","ISSN":"0162-2889","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,8,1]]},"page":"56-99","source":"MIT Press Journals","title":"Escalation through Entanglement: How the Vulnerability of Command-and-Control Systems Raises the Risks of an Inadvertent Nuclear                     War","title-short":"Escalation through Entanglement","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1162/isec_a_00320","volume":"43"},

  {"id":"akoto_internationaltradecyber_2021","abstract":"A state’s decision to engage in cyber operations has important implications for its trade. Successful cyber espionage could yield valuable trade secrets that could boost domestic production and spur economic growth. On the other hand, uncovered cyber operations could invite devastating sanctions that retard economic development. In spite of this, the nexus between trade and cyber attacks has received little attention in the literature. In this article, I explore how a state’s trade relations affect its propensity to engage in cyber attacks. I develop a theoretical framework that links the composition of a state’s trade to its deficit in proprietary information relative to other states. I decompose trade into its inter- and intra-industry components and show that while inter-industry trade is associated with higher incidence of state-sponsored cyber attacks, intra-industry trade has the opposite effect. I also show that these effects are non-monotonic, varying by the share of inter- or intra-industry trade in total trade. The results also show that states that have a heavy concentration of high-tech industries such as aerospace, computers, and pharmaceuticals have a higher propensity to engage in cyber espionage operations. These results are robust to a variety of controls and specifications.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Akoto","given":"William"}],"container-title":"Journal of Peace Research","container-title-short":"Journal of Peace Research","DOI":"10.1177/0022343320964549","ISSN":"0022-3433","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,25]]},"language":"en","page":"0022343320964549","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"International trade and cyber conflict: Decomposing the effect of trade on state-sponsored cyber attacks","title-short":"International trade and cyber conflict","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022343320964549"},

  {"id":"altman_redlinesfaits_2015","abstract":"The International Relations literature has an established view of interstate crises that explains how states pursue victory in terms of signaling resolve. States make gains with credible coercive threats (compellence). In contrast, this dissertation conceives of each crisis as a strategic competition between a challenger seeking to make gains unilaterally by fait accompli and its adversary's countervailing efforts to set red lines to deter these faits accomplis. After clarifying the neglected concepts of \"red line\" and \"fait accompli,\" the dissertation takes up two questions the literature has left unexplored: When are faits accomplis likely to occur? When are they likely to lead to war? The result is a theory of coercive conflict explaining why deterrent red lines that contain any of four weaknesses -- types of gray areas, in essence -- are especially vulnerable to faits accomplis. This theory is tested with two case studies -- the 1948-1949 Berlin Blockade Crisis and the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis -- and an analysis of gray areas and land grabs in territorial crises since 1918. Making extensive use of declassified documents, the case studies show that the \"game\" of crises need not be a matter of convincing the adversary of one's willingness to fight. Instead, states pursue victory by finding gray areas and other weaknesses in deterrent red lines that they can exploit to unilaterally take as much as possible -- often by fait accompli -- without crossing the line and overtly firing on the other side. Crises, from this standpoint, are a game of finding ways to advance without attacking. The analysis of territorial crises makes use of original data on all land grab faits accomplis since 1918. It shows first that states far more often make territorial gains by fait accompli than by coercing a territorial cession. It then focuses on the impact of geographical gray areas, which take two forms: islands located awkwardly between two core territories and border ambiguities. It finds that two-thirds of all land grabs since 1918 targeted a gray area. These gray areas render faits accomplis more effective at making a gain without provoking war and, consequently, more likely to occur.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Altman","given":"Daniel W.

Specifically, what are the vulnerabilities in each red line that proliferators can exploit to advance their nuclear program while limiting the punitive response?

Drawing on within-case analysis of the conduct of war during the past thirty years in Afghanistan, I demonstrate that what we now consider to be “hybrid” represents an important continuity and strategic option in Afghan warfare. Still, the analysis also demonstrates that choosing “hybrid” has not been a strategy that has worked. Hezb-i-Islami's rather limited attempt for conventionalization of the war against the forces of Dostum and Massoud in 1992 failed and the Taliban's more far-reaching attempt for conventionalization has so far also failed to reap strategic success.

This study familiarizes conflict scholars with a recently proposed split-population model—the zero-inflated ordered probit (ZiOP) model—that explicitly addresses the econometric challenges that researchers face when using a “zero-inflated” ordered dependent variable. We show that the ZiOP model provides more than an econometric fix: it provides substantively rich information about the heterogeneous pool of “peace” observations that exist in zero-inflated ordinal variables that measure violent conflict.

This claim is theorized by examining how geographical distance influences the international and domestic costs of alliance commitments. The empirical tests reveal that a potential aggressor is less likely to initiate a militarized dispute against a target with proximate defensive allies. Furthermore, I find that the power of proximate defensive allies is a more significant determinant of successful extended general deterrence than that of distance allies.

  {"id":"baliga_deterrenceimperfectattribution_2020","abstract":"Motivated by recent developments in cyberwarfare, we study deterrence in a world where attacks cannot be perfectly attributed to attackers. In the model, each of \n\n\n$$ n $$\n\n\n attackers may attack the defender. The defender observes a noisy signal that probabilistically attributes the attack. The defender may retaliate against one or more attackers and wants to retaliate against the guilty attacker only. We note an endogenous strategic complementarity among the attackers: if one attacker becomes more aggressive, that attacker becomes more “suspect” and the other attackers become less suspect, which leads the other attackers to become more aggressive as well. Despite this complementarity, there is a unique equilibrium. We identify types of improvements in attribution that strengthen deterrence—namely, improving attack detection independently of any effect on the identifiability of the attacker, reducing false alarms, or replacing misidentification with non-detection. However, we show that other improvements in attribution can backfire, weakening deterrence—these include detecting more attacks where the attacker is difficult to identify or pursuing too much certainty in attribution. Deterrence is improved if the defender can commit to a retaliatory strategy in advance, but the defender should not always commit to retaliate more after every signal.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Baliga","given":"Sandeep"},{"family":"Mesquita","given":"Ethan Bueno De"},{"family":"Wolitzky","given":"Alexander"}],"container-title":"American Political Science Review","DOI":"10.1017/S0003055420000362","ISSN":"0003-0554, 1537-5943","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"en","page":"1155-1178","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Deterrence with Imperfect Attribution","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/deterrence-with-imperfect-attribution/FAA1B972880D47696942E89628E81383","volume":"114"},

  {"id":"beckley_economicdevelopmentmilitary_2010","abstract":"What makes some states more militarily powerful than others? A growing body of research suggests that certain ‘non-material’ factors significantly affect a country's ability to translate resources into fighting power. In particular, recent studies claim that democracy, Western culture, high levels of human capital, and amicable civil-military relations enhance military effectiveness. If these studies are correct, then military power is not solely or even primarily determined by material resources, and a large chunk of international relations scholarship has been based on a flawed metric. The major finding of this article, however, suggests that this is not the case. In hundreds of battles between 1898 and 1987, the more economically developed side consistently outfought the poorer side on a soldier-for-soldier basis. This is not surprising. What is surprising is that many of the non-material factors posited to affect military capability seem to be irrelevant: when economic development is taken into account, culture and human capital become insignificant and democracy actually seems to degrade warfighting capability. In short, the conventional military dominance of Western democracies stems from superior economic development, not societal pathologies or political institutions. Therefore, a conception of military power that takes into account both the quantity of a state's resources and its level of economic development provides a sound basis for defense planning and international relations scholarship.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,9,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Beckley","given":"Michael"}],"container-title":"Journal of Strategic Studies","DOI":"10.1080/01402391003603581","ISSN":"0140-2390","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,2,1]]},"page":"43-79","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Economic Development and Military Effectiveness","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01402391003603581","volume":"33"},

Some argue that this model is widely applicable, enabling a major restructuring of the U.S. military and considerable freedom for American military intervention. An assessment of such claims in light of recent combat experience in Afghanistan and Iraq, however, finds the model's applicability to be more limited. Where U.S. allies have had skills and motivation comparable to their enemies', the Afghan model has proven extremely lethal even without U.S. conventional ground forces. But where U.S. allies have lacked these skills, they have proven unable to exploit the potential of American airpower.

  {"id":"blackwill_warothermeans_2016","abstract":"Today, nations increasingly carry out geopolitical combat through economic means. Policies governing everything from trade and investment to energy and exchange rates are wielded as tools to win diplomatic allies, punish adversaries, and coerce those in between. Not so in the United States, however. America still too often reaches for the gun over the purse to advance its interests abroad. The result is a playing field sharply tilting against the United States. In a cogent analysis of why the United States is losing ground as a world power and what it can do to reverse the trend, War by Other Means describes the statecraft of geoeconomics: the use of economic instruments to achieve geopolitical goals. Geoeconomics has long been a lever of America's foreign policy. But factors ranging from U.S. bureaucratic politics to theories separating economics from foreign policy leave America ill prepared for this new era of geoeconomic contest, while rising powers, especially China, are adapting rapidly. The rules-based system Americans set in place after World War II benefited the United States for decades, but now, as the system frays and global competitors take advantage, America is uniquely self-constrained. Its geoeconomic policies are hampered by neglect and resistance, leaving the United States overly reliant on traditional military force. Drawing on immense scholarship and government experience, Robert Blackwill and Jennifer Harris show that if America's policies are left uncorrected, the price in American blood and treasure will only grow. What geoeconomic warfare requires is a new vision of U.S. statecraft.","author":[{"family":"Blackwill","given":"Robert D."},{"family":"Harris","given":"Jennifer M."}],"ISBN":"978-0-674-73721-1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,4,11]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"377","publisher":"Harvard University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"War by Other Means","type":"book"},

Whereas the United States and many other advanced powers see these new strategic capabilities as useful mainly to disrupt enemies’ physical infrastructure and military command and control, Russia, because of its historical experience and the legacy of Soviet thinking, sees IW and IO in an additional light. While not denigrating their usefulness for the aforementioned purposes, Russian thinkers see IW and IO as a new means to conduct large-scale political warfare to reshape the thinking of an entire political community. Indeed, Moscow has followed this approach in its information strategy—in the war in Chechnya after 1999 and more recently at home to suppress movements for reform.

Can states use cyber means as independent tools of coercion to influence the behavior of adversaries? This article critically assesses traditional coercion theory in light of cyberspace's emergence as a domain in which states use force, or its threat, to achieve political objectives. First, we review the core tenets of coercion theory and identify the requisites of successful coercion: clearly communicated threats; a cost–benefit calculus; credibility; and reassurance. We subsequently explore the extent to which each of these is feasible for or applicable to the cyber domain, highlighting how the dynamics of coercion in cyberspace mimic versus diverge from traditional domains of warfare. We demonstrate that cyber power alone has limited effectiveness as a tool of coercion, although it has significant utility when coupled with other elements of national power. Second, this article assesses the viability and effectiveness of six prominent warfighting strategies in the traditional coercion literature as applied to the cyber domain: attrition, denial, decapitation, intimidation, punishment, and risk. We conclude that, based on the current technological state of the field, states are only likely to achieve desired objectives employing attrition, denial, or decapitation strategies. Our analysis also has unique implications for the conduct of warfare in cyberspace. Perhaps counterintuitively, the obstacles to coercion that our analysis identifies may prompt states to reevaluate norms against targeting civilian infrastructure.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,5,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Borghard","given":"Erica"},{"family":"Lonergan","given":"Shawn"}],"container-title":"Security Studies","DOI":"10.1080/09636412.2017.1306396","ISSN":"0963-6412","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,7,3]]},"page":"452-481","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"The Logic of Coercion in Cyberspace","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09636412.2017.1306396","volume":"26"},

  {"id":"brecher_studycrisis_1997","abstract":"As the twentieth century draws to a close, it is time to look back on an epoch of widespread turmoil, including two world wars, the end of the colonial era in world history, and a large number of international crises and conflicts. This book is designed to shed light on the causes and consequences of military-security crises since the end of World War I, in every region, across diverse economic and political regimes, and cultures. The primary aim of this volume is to uncover patterns of crises, conflicts and wars and thereby to contribute to the advancement of international peace and world order. The culmination of more than twenty years of research by Michael Brecher and Jonathan Wilkenfeld, the book analyzes crucial themes about crisis, conflict, and war and presents systematic knowledge about more than 400 crises, thirty-one protracted conflicts and almost 900 state participants. The authors explore many aspects of conflict, including the ethnic dimension, the effect of different kinds of political regimes--notably the question whether democracies are more peaceful than authoritarian regimes, and the role of violence in crisis management. They employ both case studies and aggregate data analysis in a Unified Model of Crisis to focus on two levels of analysis--hostile interactions among states, and the behavior of decision-makers who must cope with the challenge posed by a threat to values, time pressure, and the increased likelihood that military hostilities will engulf them. This book will appeal to scholars in history, political science, sociology, and economics as well as policy makers interested in the causes and effects of crises in international relations. The rich data sets will serve researchers for years to come as they probe additional aspects of crisis, conflict and war in international relations. Michael Brecher is R. B.

A new framework that avoids unipolarity's conceptual pitfalls and provides a systematic approach to measuring how the distribution of capabilities is changing in twenty-first-century global politics demonstrates that the United States will long remain the only state with the capability to be a superpower. In addition, China is in a class by itself, one that the unipolarity concept cannot explain. To assess the speed with which China's rise might transform this into something other than a one-superpower system, analogies from past power transitions are misleading. Unlike past rising powers, China is at a much lower technological level than the leading state, and the gap separating Chinese and U.S. military capabilities is much larger than it was in the past. In addition, the very nature of power has changed: the greatly enhanced difficulty of converting economic capacity into military capacity makes the transition from a great power to a superpower much harder now than it was in the past.

  {"id":"brooks_shapingstrategycivilmilitary_2008","abstract":"Good strategic assessment does not guarantee success in international relations, but bad strategic assessment dramatically increases the risk of disastrous failure. The most glaring example of this reality is playing out in Iraq today. But what explains why states and their leaders are sometimes so good at strategic assessment--and why they are sometimes so bad at it? Part of the explanation has to do with a state's civil-military relations. In Shaping Strategy, Risa Brooks develops a novel theory of how states' civil-military relations affect strategic assessment during international conflicts. And her conclusions have broad practical importance: to anticipate when states are prone to strategic failure abroad, we must look at how civil-military relations affect the analysis of those strategies at home.  Drawing insights from both international relations and comparative politics, Shaping Strategy shows that good strategic assessment depends on civil-military relations that encourage an easy exchange of information and a rigorous analysis of a state's own relative capabilities and strategic environment. Among the diverse case studies the book illuminates, Brooks explains why strategic assessment in Egypt was so poor under Gamal Abdel Nasser prior to the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and why it improved under Anwar Sadat. The book also offers a new perspective on the devastating failure of U.S. planning for the second Iraq war. Brooks argues that this failure, far from being unique, is an example of an assessment pathology to which states commonly succumb.","author":[{"family":"Brooks","given":"Risa"}],"ISBN":"978-0-691-13668-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"330","publisher":"Princeton University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Shaping Strategy: The Civil-military Politics of Strategic Assessment","title-short":"Shaping Strategy","type":"book"},

There is an obvious answer: to steal valuable information or to attack. But this isn't the full story. This book draws on often-overlooked documents leaked by Edward Snowden, real-world case studies of cyber operations, and policymaker perspectives to show that intruding into other countries' networks has enormous defensive value as well. Two nations, neither of which seeks to harm the other but neither of which trusts the other, will often find it prudent to launch intrusions. This general problem, in which a nation's means of securing itself threatens the security of others and risks escalating tension, is a bedrock concept in international relations and is called the 'security dilemma'. This book shows not only that the security dilemma applies to cyber operations, but also that the particular characteristics of the digital domain mean that the effects are deeply pronounced. The cybersecurity dilemma is both a vital concern of modern statecraft and a means of accessibly understanding the essential components of cyber operations.","author":[{"family":"Buchanan","given":"Ben"}],"ISBN":"978-0-19-066501-2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"300","publisher":"Oxford University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"The Cybersecurity Dilemma: Hacking, Trust, and Fear Between Nations","title-short":"The Cybersecurity Dilemma","type":"book"},

Yet we lack adequate theory to designate some wars as candidates for bigness without relying upon knowledge of post‐war events. Such reliance introduces selection bias into much research on war. That bias may vitiate the significance of our observations. A rudimentary representation of the relationship between rationality and expected war costs is tested against data on European wars from 1815–1965. The results are consistent with expectations. The results highlight the possibility to distinguish big wars from little wars ex ante without a separate theory for each. These simple analyses in conjunction with recent research on war diffusion remind us of the possibility that so‐called big wars may not be different in their underlying logic from lesser wars, but rather represent the manifestation of different values on a set of generally important variables.

The contention herein is that the answer gains more accuracy if one takes a much longer historical standpoint beginning with classical civilization and moving through the medieval period to our modern world. With regard to the present, this epochal warfare analysis projects that a shift from a Westphalian to post-Westphalian global system is underway. During this period of transition – as in the transition periods between epochs which have preceded it – the dominant state form undergoes a deinstitutionalization process, and war is less about traditional issues of state sovereignty, and instead increasingly over ‘what the new form of social and political organization will be’.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,9,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Bunker","given":"Robert J."},{"family":"Bunker","given":"Pamela Ligouri"}],"container-title":"Small Wars & Insurgencies","DOI":"10.1080/09592318.2015.1129168","ISSN":"0959-2318","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,3,3]]},"page":"325-344","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"The modern state in epochal transition: The significance of irregular warfare, state deconstruction, and the rise of new warfighting entities beyond neo-medievalism","title-short":"The modern state in epochal transition","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09592318.2015.1129168","volume":"27"},

In the experiment, the officials sent out email messages to the constituents on their distribution lists. Half the constituents received messages where the official advocated for the priority of a given issue, while the other half received a placebo email. We surveyed the constituents one to two months before the message went out and again the week after the official sent the message. The experiment shows that politicians did not change citizens’ priorities in the desired direction. Moreover, citizens who received a message where the official indicated the issue was a priority were not more likely to act when invited to sign a petition on the issue. Elected officials’ ability to shape the priorities of the politically active citizens with whom they regularly communicate is limited and can even be self-defeating.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Butler","given":"Daniel M."},{"family":"Hassell","given":"Hans J.G."}],"container-title":"American Political Science Review","container-title-short":"Am Polit Sci Rev","DOI":"10.1017/S0003055418000473","ISSN":"0003-0554, 1537-5943","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,11]]},"language":"en","page":"860-873","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"On the Limits of Officials’ Ability to Change Citizens’ Priorities: A Field Experiment in Local Politics","title-short":"On the Limits of Officials’ Ability to Change Citizens’ Priorities","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0003055418000473/type/journal_article","volume":"112"},
  {"id":"buuren_flexibleimputationmissing_2012","abstract":"Missing data form a problem in every scientific discipline, yet the techniques required to handle them are complicated and often lacking. One of the great ideas in statistical science—multiple imputation—fills gaps in the data with plausible values, the uncertainty of which is coded in the data itself. It also solves other problems, many of which are missing data problems in disguise.  Flexible Imputation of Missing Data is supported by many examples using real data taken from the author's vast experience of collaborative research, and presents a practical guide for handling missing data under the framework of multiple imputation. Furthermore, detailed guidance of implementation in R using the author’s package MICE is included throughout the book.  Assuming familiarity with basic statistical concepts and multivariate methods, Flexible Imputation of Missing Data is intended for two audiences:   (Bio)statisticians, epidemiologists, and methodologists in the social and health sciences Substantive researchers who do not call themselves statisticians, but who possess the necessary skills to understand the principles and to follow the recipes   This graduate-tested book avoids mathematical and technical details as much as possible: formulas are accompanied by a verbal statement that explains the formula in layperson terms. Readers less concerned with the theoretical underpinnings will be able to pick up the general idea, and technical material is available for those who desire deeper understanding. The analyses can be replicated in R using a dedicated package developed by the author.","author":[{"family":"Buuren","given":"Stef","dropping-particle":"van"}],"ISBN":"978-1-4398-6825-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,3,29]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"326","publisher":"CRC Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Flexible Imputation of Missing Data","type":"book"},
  {"id":"buuren_fullyconditionalspecification_2006","abstract":"The use of the Gibbs sampler with fully conditionally specified models, where the distribution of each variable given the other variables is the starting point, has become a popular method to create imputations in incomplete multivariate data. The theoretical weakness of this approach is that the specified conditional densities can be incompatible, and therefore the stationary distribution to which the Gibbs sampler attempts to converge may not exist. This study investigates practical consequences of this problem by means of simulation. Missing data are created under four different missing data mechanisms. Attention is given to the statistical behavior under compatible and incompatible models. The results indicate that multiple imputation produces essentially unbiased estimates with appropriate coverage in the simple cases investigated, even for the incompatible models. Of particular interest is that these results were produced using only five Gibbs iterations starting from a simple draw from observed marginal distributions. It thus appears that, despite the theoretical weaknesses, the actual performance of conditional model specification for multivariate imputation can be quite good, and therefore deserves further study.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Buuren","given":"S.

However, traditional modeling of these outcomes ignores common data issues and cannot capture nuances. There is often an excess of zeros, the observed outcomes for different actors are inherently related, and competing actors may respond to the same factors differently. This paper extends existing models and develops a zero-inflated multivariate ordered probit to simultaneously address these issues. This model performs better than existing models at capturing the true parameters of interest, estimates the nature of the related processes, and captures the differences in actors’ decision-making.

  {"id":"carnegie_spotlightharshglare_2018","abstract":"How does publicizing states' illicit activities affect the stability of international order? What does this relationship tell us about how governments react to violations of international rules? In contrast to the conventional wisdom that transparent monitoring strengthens the normative legal order, we argue that these activities often undermine it. We develop two mechanisms through which this occurs: by raising the known rate of noncompliance, and by sharpening the threat that deviance poses to other states. We argue that when enforcers understand the dangers of publicizing transgressions, they do so selectively. Focusing on the nuclear nonproliferation domain, we demonstrate that these concerns shaped American decisions to reveal or obfuscate other states' efforts to obtain nuclear weapons. We formalize this argument and then empirically test the model's predictions using in-depth case study analyses. We find that the US failed to disclose infractions when this publicity would have undermined the rules through the two mechanisms we identify. However, while concealing violations can prevent proliferation in response to specific nuclear programs, it can also create potential dangers to a regime's overall health and stability. In addition to reassessing a widely shared assumption about the value of transparent monitoring, this article's broad theoretical framework can shed light on enforcement and compliance dynamics in a variety of international settings.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,5,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Carnegie","given":"Allison"},{"family":"Carson","given":"Austin"}],"container-title":"International Organization","DOI":"10.1017/S0020818318000176","ISSN":"0020-8183, 1531-5088","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,5]]},"language":"en","page":"1-31","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"The Spotlight's Harsh Glare: Rethinking Publicity and International Order","title-short":"The Spotlight's Harsh Glare","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-organization/article/spotlights-harsh-glare-rethinking-publicity-and-international-order/97AD0D19A1E5DF5F3D6CC5B98EA1009F#.WvOJh_dMo38.twitter"},
  {"id":"carson_facingsavingface_2016","abstract":"States pursue their cooperative and competitive goals using both public and private policy tools. Yet there is a profound mismatch between the depth, variety, and importance of covert activity and what scholars of International Relations (IR) know about it. This article addresses this gap by analyzing how adversaries struggle for influence within the covert sphere, why they often retreat to it, and when they abandon it. It focuses on secrecy among adversaries intervening in local conflicts and develops a theory about secrecy's utility as a device for creating sustainable limits in war. Drawing on insights about secrecy and face-work from the sociologist Erving Goffman, I show that major powers individually and collectively conceal evidence of foreign involvement when the danger of unintended conflict escalation is acute. Doing so creates a kind of “backstage” in which adversaries can exceed limits on war without stimulating hard-to-resist pressure to escalate further. An important payoff of the theory is making sense of puzzling cases of forbearance: even though adversaries often know about their opponent's covert activity, they often abstain from publicizing it. Such “tacit collusion” arises when both sides seek to manage escalation risks even as they compete for power and refuse to capitulate. The article evaluates the theory via several nested cases of external intervention in the Korean War. Drawing on newly available materials documenting the covert air war between secretly deployed Soviet pilots and Western forces, the cases show how adversaries can successfully limit war by concealing activity from outside audiences. Beyond highlighting the promise in studying the covert realm in world politics, the article has important implications for scholarship on coercive bargaining, reputation, state uses of secrecy, and how regime type influences conflict behavior.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,10,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Carson","given":"Austin"}],"container-title":"International Organization","DOI":"10.1017/S0020818315000284","ISSN":"1531-5088","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"page":"103-131","source":"Cambridge Journals Online","title":"Facing Off and Saving Face: Covert Intervention and Escalation Management in the Korean War","title-short":"Facing Off and Saving Face","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0020818315000284","volume":"70"},

  {"id":"cha_globalizationstudyinternational_2000","abstract":"In spite of the plethora of literature on security and globalization, there is relatively little work written by security specialists that interconnects the two. In the case of security studies, this has been in no small part because the field remains entrenched in the `foodfight' of competing realist, liberal, and constructionist research programs. In the case of the globalization literature, it has stemmed from a relatively stronger focus on the social and economic processes of globalization. This essay explores how the processes of globalization have fundamentally changed the way we think about security. It argues that non-physical security, diversification of threats, and the salience of identity are key effects of globalization in the security realm. These security effects translate into certain behavioral tendencies in a state's foreign policy that have thus far not been studied in the literature. First, globalization creates an interpenetration of foreign and domestic (`intermestic') issues such that national governments increasingly operate in spaces defined by the intersection of internal and external security. Second, globalization puts unprecedented bureaucratic innovation pressures on governments in their search for security, and creates multilateralist pressures to cooperate with substate and transnational partners rather than traditional allies. Third, globalization makes the calculation of relative capabilities extremely complex and non-linear. Finally, globalization compels contemplation of new modes of fighting as well as renders commonly accepted modes of strategic thinking and rational deterrence increasingly irrelevant. The `new' security environment in the 21st century will operate increasingly in the space defined by the interpenetration between two spheres: globalization and national identity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,1,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Cha","given":"Victor D."}],"container-title":"Journal of Peace Research","container-title-short":"Journal of Peace Research","DOI":"10.1177/0022343300037003007","ISSN":"0022-3433","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2000,5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"391-403","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Globalization and the Study of International Security","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0022343300037003007","volume":"37"},

This persistent political warfare effort largely eschews traditional military force; rather, it is focused on influencing the populations of targeted countries. Though the effects of Russian political warfare operations are hard to measure, they have likely had some effect on elections in France, the Netherlands, and elsewhere. Factors that make nations vulnerable to political warfare include physical proximity to Russia, high levels of corruption, contested politics, and cultural or historical affinities with Russia. If left unchecked, political warfare can do great damage to US power and interests by creating unwanted tensions, weakening allies, and eroding faith in democracy. The United States, as an open and democratic society, is at an automatic disadvantage when it comes to countering Russian political warfare. Nonetheless, Washington can seek to defend its interests by investing in effective counter-messaging, ensuring that the US intelligence community has the analytical and collection resources it needs, prioritizing anti-corruption programs in certain countries, and helping to build defense institutions in allied and partner nations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,9,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Chivvis","given":"Christopher"}],"container-title":"Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists","DOI":"10.1080/00963402.2017.1362903","ISSN":"0096-3402","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,9,3]]},"page":"316-321","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Hybrid war: Russian contemporary political warfare","title-short":"Hybrid war","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00963402.2017.1362903","volume":"73"},

While a large amount of empirical research has pursued these topics separately, multivariate conditional combinations of these processes have been relatively scarce to date. An argument for doing so is provided by Vasquez's steps-to-war theory which organizes international relations into an interactive complex of factors, including territorial disputes, interstate rivalry, recurrent crises, alliances, military buildups, and war onset. A model linking indicators of these processes is developed and tested for the 1919–95 era. Substantial empirical support for their interactions emerges. Territorial disputes in the context of rivalry and recurrent crises, aggravated by military buildups and asymmetrical external alliance situations, combine to make escalations to war more probable.

While research on rivalries and recurrent conflict suggest that crises are related over time, others (Gartzke and Simon 1999) doubt the empirical and theoretical foundations of this research. We agree with the critics that the proposition that conflicts between adversaries are related over time remains only weakly substantiated. To fill this lacuna, we test four hypotheses relating past crisis behavior and sequences to subsequent conflict, using International Crisis Behavior (ICB) project data. Our results support the serial crisis hypothesis and suggest that the probability of subsequent crises and wars increase with each past crisis. Our findings also reinforce the inclination to give more emphasis to the analysis of rivalries.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,9,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Colaresi","given":"Michael P."},{"family":"Thompson","given":"William R."}],"container-title":"The Journal of Politics","container-title-short":"The Journal of Politics","ISSN":"0022-3816","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2002]]},"page":"1175-1198","source":"JSTOR","title":"Hot Spots or Hot Hands?

  {"id":"crawford_pivotaldeterrencethirdparty_2003","abstract":"As the preponderant world power, the United States is a potential arbiter of war and peace between such feuding rivals as India and Pakistan, Turkey and Greece, China and Taiwan. How can it deter them from going to war and impel them to accept compromise without firmly choosing sides? This age-old strategic dilemma, which Timothy W. Crawford calls \"pivotal deterrence,\" has become a central challenge of international security in today's unipolar world. Crawford explains the political dynamics of pivotal deterrence and the conditions under which it is likely to succeed, while examining some of its most impressive feats and failures. German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck's agile approach to the 1870s Eastern Crisis, which prevented war between Russia and Austria-Hungary, is contrasted with Britain's ambiguous and ill-fated maneuvers to deter Germany and France in July 1914. Shifting to the 1960s Cold War, Crawford explores the successes and setbacks in U.S. efforts to prevent NATO allies Greece and Turkey from fighting over Cyprus and to defuse the Kashmir conflict between India and Pakistan. Capping the analysis is a rich look at similar U.S. efforts in the 1990s in South Asia, the Aegean, the Balkans, and East Asia. Crawford concludes with an assessment of the prospects for American pivotal deterrence in the years ahead and its implications for international relations theory.","author":[{"family":"Crawford","given":"Timothy"}],"ISBN":"978-0-8014-4097-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"308","publisher":"Cornell University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Pivotal Deterrence: Third-party Statecraft and the Pursuit of Peace","title-short":"Pivotal Deterrence","type":"book"},

The issue of relative capabilities has been extensively analyzed, yet the core problem concerns credible intentions. The strategic literature is largely influenced by commitment theory prescribing various “manipulation of risk” strategies intended to enhance threat credibility. A few analysts, however, challenge this view and recognize the importance of “intrinsic interests” in the issues at stake (i.e., inherent credibility), which can limit the effectiveness of costly signals. These two alternative views are quantitatively tested in the cases of major-powers deterrence from 1895 to 1985. A new measure of the observable category of inherent credibility is also introduced, consisting of the regional interests of major powers in the area of dispute. The results indicate strong and significant effects of regional interests on both the onset and outcomes of extended-immediate deterrence, thus suggesting relevant theoretical and policy implications.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,2,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Danilovic","given":"Vesna"}],"container-title":"Journal of Conflict Resolution","container-title-short":"Journal of Conflict Resolution","DOI":"10.1177/0022002701045003005","ISSN":"0022-0027","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2001]]},"language":"en","page":"341-369","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"The Sources of Threat Credibility in Extended Deterrence","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0022002701045003005","volume":"45"},

Yet most large and rapid shifts result from endogenous military investments. We show that when the investment decision is perfectly transparent, peace prevails. Large and rapid power shifts are deterred through the threat of a preventive war. When investments remain undetected, however, states may be tempted to introduce power shifts as a fait accompli. Knowing this, their adversaries may strike preventively even without conclusive evidence of militarization. In fact, the more effective preventive wars are, the more likely they will be launched against states that are not militarizing. Our argument emphasizes the role of imperfect information as a cause of war. It also explains why powerful states may attack weaker targets even with ambiguous evidence of their militarization.

Yet the empirical literature offers mixed findings: some studies find arms and allies to be substitutes, while others find them to be complements.

Since democracies are highly credible allies, states that form alliances with democracies can confidently reduce their internal arms. This is not the case when states form alliances with non-democracies. This study evaluates the argument using data on military expenditures and defense pacts from 1950 to 2001.

This study theorizes that the capacity to pose existential threats shapes nuclear-armed states’ willingness to use military force against one another. We explore three hypotheses regarding how nuclear-based existential threats can deter conflict or encourage it, including under the conditions proposed by the stability–instability paradox. We rely on a statistical analysis of nuclear-armed dyads from 1950 to 2001 and employ the Nuclear Annihilation Threat (NAT) Index to capture variation in the existential threats nuclear-armed states pose to one another. We find that being able to pose an existential threat to another state emboldens potential initiators to use military force but does not deter attacks. The emboldening effects are particularly strong under the hypothesized conditions of the stability–instability paradox.

We also find that after controlling for per capita income, more ethnically or religiously diverse countries have been no more likely to experience significant civil violence in this period. We argue for understanding civil war in this period in terms of insurgency or rural guerrilla warfare, a particular form of military practice that can be harnessed to diverse political agendas. The factors that explain which countries have been at risk for civil war are not their ethnic or religious characteristics but rather the conditions that favor insurgency. These include poverty—which marks financially and bureaucratically weak states and also favors rebel recruitment—political instability, rough terrain, and large populations.We wish to thank the many people who provided comments on earlier versions of this paper in a series of seminar presentations.

  {"id":"fearon_rationalistexplanationswar_1995","abstract":"Realist and other scholars commonly hold that rationally led states can and sometimes do fight when no peaceful bargains exist that both would prefer to war. Against this view, I show that under very broad conditions there will exist negotiated settlements that genuinely rational states would mutually prefer to a risky and costly fight. Popular rationalist and realist explanations for war fail either to address or to explain adequately what would prevent leaders from locating a less costly bargain. Essentially just two mechanisms can resolve this puzzle on strictly rationalist terms. The first turns on the fact that states have both private information about capabilities and resolve and the incentive to misrepresent it. The second turns on the fact that in specific strategic contexts states may be unable credibly to commit to uphold a mutually preferable bargain. Historical examples suggest that both mechanisms are empirically plausible.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,11,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Fearon","given":"James D."}],"container-title":"International Organization","DOI":"10.1017/S0020818300033324","ISSN":"1531-5088","issue":"03","issued":{"date-parts":[[1995,6]]},"page":"379–414","source":"Cambridge Journals Online","title":"Rationalist explanations for war","type":"article-journal","volume":"49"},
  {"id":"fearon_signalingforeignpolicy_1997","abstract":"The author distinguishes between two types of costly signals that state leaders might employ in trying to credibly communicate their foreign policy interests to other states, whether in the realm of grand strategy or crisis diplomacy. Leaders might either (a) tie hands by creating audience costs that they will suffer ex post if they do not follow through on their threat or commitment (i.e., costs arising from the actions of domestic political audiences) or (b) sink costs by taking actions such as mobilizing troops that are financially costly ex ante. Analysis of a game model depicting the essentials of each case yields two principal results. First, in the games' equilibria, leaders never bluff with either type of signal; they do not incur or create costs and then fail to respond if challenged. Second, leaders do better on average by tying hands, despite the fact that the ability to do so creates a greater ex ante risk of war than does the use of sunk-cost signals. These results and the logic behind them may help explain some empirical features of international signaling, such as many crises' appearance as competitions in creating domestic political audience costs. They also generate empirical puzzles, such as why the seemingly plausible logic of inference that undermines bluffing in the model does not operate in all empirical cases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,10,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Fearon","given":"James D."}],"container-title":"Journal of Conflict Resolution","container-title-short":"Journal of Conflict Resolution","DOI":"10.1177/0022002797041001004","ISSN":"0022-0027, 1552-8766","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[1997,2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"68-90","source":"jcr.sagepub.com","title":"Signaling Foreign Policy Interests Tying Hands versus Sinking Costs","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://jcr.sagepub.com/content/41/1/68","volume":"41"},

  {"id":"friedman_seapowerstrategynavies_2001","abstract":"A noted defense analyst and naval weapons expert lays out the roles of navies and naval strategy in the twenty-first century. Drawing upon historical examples, Norman Friedman first explains how and why naval strategy differs from other kinds of military strategy and then provides a sense of the special flavor of a maritime or naval approach to national security problems. The various uses of navies are described and illustrated by extended case studies covering the last quarter-millennium. Friedman presents these observations in the context of U.S. post-Cold War security concerns and concepts. He explains how and why the United States currently espouses a maritime strategy and argues that navies are likely to regain a dominant position due to changes both in their own technology and in air and ground forces. He urges countries with the appropriate geographical and economic advantages, namely the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Australia, to use their inherent maritime leverage.Rare among books on naval strategy, this work combines an examination of the vital role of coalition partners, especially those with significant ground forces, with a comprehensive survey of relevant technology and the way that strategy can be reflected in the design of an evolving fleet. The author is known for his ability to explain modern technology to lay audiences, and his book is suitable for all those interested in public policy questions as well as national security professionals and students of strategy. The book's publication at a time of potential change in U.S. national strategy only reinforces its value as a document worthy of study.","author":[{"family":"Friedman","given":"Norman"}],"ISBN":"978-1-55750-291-9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2001]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"352","publisher":"Naval Institute Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Seapower as Strategy: Navies and National Interests","title-short":"Seapower as Strategy","type":"book"},
  {"id":"fuhrmann_extendednucleardeterrence_2018","abstract":"This analysis discusses the central challenges that countries face when they practice extended nuclear deterrence. One key problem has to do with credibility: potential aggressors may not believe that a country would fight to defend an ally, particularly if doing so risks a nuclear attack against its homeland. Countries might be able to address this issue by forging formal alliances with protégés or by stationing nuclear forces on the protégé’s territory. Do these measures discourage third-party aggression? Defence pacts involving nuclear-armed states effectively bolster extended deterrence. One risk of extending nuclear protection from the American perspective, however, is that it might pull the United States into unwanted wars by risk-acceptant protégés. Yet, in a nuclear context, the risk of alliance entrapment is generally overblown. Placing nuclear weapons on an ally’s territory does much less to bolster extended deterrence than one might initially think. Although foreign nuclear deployments may reassure allies and promote non-proliferation to some degree, their value for extended deterrence is fairly minimal. The United States continues to deploy nuclear weapons in five European countries, but the case for maintaining these deployments is decidedly weak.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Fuhrmann","given":"Matthew"}],"container-title":"Diplomacy & Statecraft","DOI":"10.1080/09592296.2017.1420526","ISSN":"0959-2296","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"page":"51-73","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"On Extended Nuclear Deterrence","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/09592296.2017.1420526","volume":"29"},

  {"id":"gartzke_complexstructurecommercial_2016","abstract":"Researchers continue to debate the impact of trade on interstate conflict. While many view trade as pacifying, others argue that dependencies increase friction and the risk of war. We provide a theory that explains how cross-border economic ties alternately enhance or impede international cooperation. Three main factors account for the heterogeneous effects of trade on conflict: interdependence, asymmetry, and multipolarity. Interdependence can act as a substitute for, or as a deterrent to, militarized violence. In the former case, interdependence actually increases more modest non-militarized conflict, while also discouraging militarized disputes. Asymmetry diminishes the conflict-inhibiting effect of trade ties, as dependency cannot simultaneously be used to coerce and to inform. Multilateral trade networks alternately moderate or enhance the bilateral effects of interdependence and asymmetry on interstate peace. Our theory and evidence reveal complex, cross-cutting consequences of economic interdependence on conflict behavior and also demonstrate effects well beyond the dyad, suggesting the need to include extradyadic ties in future theoretical and empirical research studying the commercial peace.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,5,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Gartzke","given":"Erik"},{"family":"Westerwinter","given":"Oliver"}],"container-title":"Journal of Peace Research","container-title-short":"Journal of Peace Research","DOI":"10.1177/0022343316637895","ISSN":"0022-3433, 1460-3578","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"325-343","source":"jpr.sagepub.com","title":"The complex structure of commercial peace contrasting trade interdependence, asymmetry, and multipolarity","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://jpr.sagepub.com/content/53/3/325","volume":"53"},

Participants in the debate suggest several                causes, but we show that alternative variable constructions are sufficient to                account for the discrepant findings.

As such, conflict over the internet is much more likely to serve as an adjunct to, rather than a substitute for, existing modes of terrestrial force.

  {"id":"gartzke_thermonuclearcyberwar_2016","abstract":"Cyberwar is routinely over-hyped as a substitute weapon of mass destruction. More typically, cyber operations work as complements to power in other domains, generally limiting the aggressive potential of cyberspace on its own. However, there are situations where complementarity can undermine the stability of other domains in the most dramatic fashion. We examine the unusual contingency of a nuclear brinksmanship crisis in which offensive cyber operations (OCO) against nuclear weapons and/or their command, control, and communications (NC3) undermine deterrence and make war more likely. Nuclear nations have traditionally been free to display their nuclear capabilities openly — often in contrast to other forms of military power — given the lack of effective countermeasures to nuclear attack and its obvious destructiveness. Nuclear transparency in turn makes it easier to judge the balance of power, reducing the danger of misperception and war. Military advantages achieved in cyberspace typically cannot be disclosed without compromising their military effectiveness. Because of this commitment problem, OCO are best used rather than threatened. Unfortunately, the same warfighting advantages of NC3 OCO become dangerous liabilities for deterrence. Variation in operational capacity to conduct, detect, and mitigate NC3 OCO can be expected to make brinksmanship crises more or less unstable, should they occur. Increased uncertainty about the true balance of power will tend to undermine both nuclear and conventional stability. Policy measures must look to improve rather than degrade nuclear transparency.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,9,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Gartzke","given":"Erik"},{"family":"Lindsay","given":"Jon R."}],"event-place":"Rochester, NY","genre":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,6,15]]},"number":"ID 2836208","publisher":"Social Science Research Network","publisher-place":"Rochester, NY","source":"papers.ssrn.com","title":"Thermonuclear Cyberwar","type":"report","URL":"http://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2836208"},

  {"id":"gartzke_warerrorterm_1999","abstract":"At least since Thucydides, students of international relations have sought rational explanations for the advent of war. Rationalist explanations assume purposive action; states are said to make reasoned decisions about the use of force.

We cannot predict in individual cases whether states will go to war, because war is typically the consequence of variables that are unobservable ex ante, both to us as researchers and to the participants. Thinking probabilistically continues to offer the opportunity to assess international conflict empirically. However, the realization that uncertainty is necessary theoretically to motivate war is much different from recognizing that the empirical world contains a stochastic element. Accepting uncertainty as a necessary condition of war implies that all other variables—however detailed the explanation—serve to eliminate gradations of irrelevant alternatives. We can progressively refine our ability to distinguish states that may use force from those that are likely to remain at peace, but anticipating wars from a pool of states that appear willing to fight will remain problematic. For example, we may achieve considerable success in anticipating crises, but our ability to predict which crises will become wars will probably prove little better than the naive predictions of random chance. The need for uncertainty to account for war means that the same conditions thought to account for war must also exist among states not destined to fight. Otherwise, states themselves will differentiate between opponents in a way that either removes the motives for war or restores uncertainty. It has long been accepted that social processes possess an element of uncertainty, but the centrality of uncertainty to rationalist explanations for war means that the advent of war is itself stochastic. War is literally in the “error term.”","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,7,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Gartzke","given":"Erik"}],"container-title":"International Organization","DOI":"10.1162/002081899550995","ISSN":"1531-5088","issue":"03","issued":{"date-parts":[[1999,6]]},"page":"567–587","source":"Cambridge Journals Online","title":"War Is in the Error Term","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0020818399440810","volume":"53"},

This argument mistakes the ease of deception on the Internet for a categorical ease of attack. As intelligence agencies have long known, deception is a double-edged sword. Covert attackers must exercise restraint against complex targets in order to avoid compromises resulting in mission failure or retaliation. More importantly, defenders can also employ deceptive concealment and ruses to confuse or ensnare aggressors. Indeed, deception can reinvigorate traditional strategies of deterrence and defense against cyber threats, as computer security practitioners have already discovered. The strategy of deception has other important implications: as deterrence became foundational in the nuclear era, deception should rise in prominence in a world that increasingly depends on technology to mediate interaction.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,6,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Gartzke","given":"Erik"},{"family":"Lindsay","given":"Jon R."}],"container-title":"Security Studies","DOI":"10.1080/09636412.2015.1038188","ISSN":"0963-6412","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,4,3]]},"page":"316-348","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Weaving Tangled Webs: Offense, Defense, and Deception in Cyberspace","title-short":"Weaving Tangled Webs","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09636412.2015.1038188","volume":"24"},

A novel feature of our NATO estimates is the spatial autoregressive (SAR) weighting of alliance spillovers of defense spending based on ally contiguity (augmented by US defense spending) and inverse distance between allies. The spatial models provide defense demand estimates that are amazingly consistent with those of the standard spillover model. In particular, free riding is prevalent in all three sets of estimates for the three sample periods and changing set of allies. In addition, the influences of the controls are generally robust, including the effect of the change in strategic doctrine in 1975 that augmented the importance of conventional weapons and, thus, spatial factors. We also present mutual assured destruction (MAD) era defense demand estimations dating back to 1960 and 1950 to show that spatial-based spillovers only matter in the post-MAD era after 1974.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,3]]},"author":[{"family":"George","given":"Justin"},{"family":"Sandler","given":"Todd"}],"container-title":"European Journal of Political Economy","container-title-short":"European Journal of Political Economy","DOI":"10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2017.09.002","ISSN":"0176-2680","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,7,1]]},"page":"222-236","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Demand for military spending in NATO, 1968–2015: A spatial panel approach","title-short":"Demand for military spending in NATO, 1968–2015","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268017301581","volume":"53"},

  {"id":"gerson_nofirstuse_2010","abstract":"The release of the Barack Obama administration's much-anticipated Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) concluded an intense, yearlong effort to revamp U.S. nuclear weapons policy to better address modern threats. Despite general agreement that the United States' nuclear policy and posture was in need of overhaul, there were strong disagreements over what kinds of changes should be made. At the core of these debates was the issue of U.S. declaratory policy—the stated role and purpose of U.S. nuclear weapons. Whereas some members of the administration advocated that the United States retain all of the flexibility and options afforded by the policy of calculated ambiguity, others contended that to fulfill President Obama's commitment to “put an end to Cold War thinking” and “reduce the role of nuclear weapons in U.S. national security strategy,” the United States should adopt a more restrictive nuclear policy such as no first use (NFU), perhaps in the form of a declaration that the “sole purpose” of U.S. nuclear weapons is to deter a nuclear attack. By not adopting NFU, the NPR missed an important opportunity to reduce the role of nuclear weapons in U.S. strategy. The traditional case for NFU hinges on the argument that the threat of nuclear first use is unnecessary for deterrence. Yet the continued U.S. option to use nuclear weapons first is not only unnecessary but dangerous. Given the size and accuracy of the current U.S. nuclear arsenal, and given the variation in the nuclear capabilities of current and potential adversaries, the first-use option risks creating instabilities in a severe crisis that increase the chances of accidental, unauthorized, or deliberate nuclear use. In a future crisis with a nuclear-armed state, the fear—whether real or imagined—that the United States might attempt a disarming nuclear first-strike increases the possibility of nuclear escalation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,8,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Gerson","given":"Michael S."}],"container-title":"International Security","container-title-short":"International Security","DOI":"10.1162/ISEC_a_00018","ISSN":"0162-2889","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,9,17]]},"page":"7-47","source":"MIT Press Journals","title":"No First Use: The Next Step for U.S. Nuclear Policy","title-short":"No First Use","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/ISEC_a_00018","volume":"35"},

The literature tends to equate external causes with threats; the chapter argues for a broader understanding that includes all causes of rational arming behavior. Internal causes of arms races are then understood to be factors within the state that lead it to adopt suboptimal policies. Although the causes and consequences of arms races are usually dealt with separately, in fact they are closely connected. When a state engages in an arms race because this is its best option, the state is acting rationally, the causes of the arms race are external, and the arms race has no consequences of its own. In contrast, when a state arms because domestic interests have distorted its policy, the arms race produces negative consequences. Research on the consequences of arms races has been hindered by the lack of a fully developed theory of when a state shouldrace; progress on defensive realism is helping to fill this gap.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,9,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Glaser","given":"Charles L."}],"container-title":"Annual Review of Political Science","DOI":"10.1146/annurev.polisci.3.1.251","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2000]]},"page":"251-276","source":"Annual Reviews","title":"The Causes and Consequences of Arms Races","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.polisci.3.1.251","volume":"3"},

As a result, they prescribe the wrong type of military policy and reduce states' security. This article explores how a variety of factors interact to produce political consequences.

The article reformulates Jervis's spiral and deterrence models and argues that they overlook types of adversaries, including most importantly insecure greedy states; that shifts in the adversary's balance of domestic power offer an alternative to individual learning as the basic way in which political consequences are generated; that national-level failures of evaluation provide an alternative source of exaggerated insecurity; and that these differences can require the defender to follow different policies.

The final section addresses basic criticisms of the security dilemma, including the empirical claim that greedy states are the key source of international conflict, that the security dilemma does not really exist, and that offense-defense theory is flawed.

Will the future of the Net be set by Internet engineers, rogue programmers, the United Nations, or powerful countries? Who's really in control of what's happening on the Net? In this provocative new book, Jack Goldsmith and Tim Wu tell the fascinating story of the Internet's challenge to governmental rule in the 1990s, and the ensuing battles with governments around the world. It's a book about the fate of one idea--that the Internet might liberate us forever from government, borders, and even our physical selves. We learn of Google's struggles with the French government and Yahoo's capitulation to the Chinese regime; of how the European Union sets privacy standards on the Net for the entire world; and of eBay's struggles with fraud and how it slowly learned to trust the FBI. In a decade of events the original vision is uprooted, as governments time and time again assert their power to direct the future of the Internet. The destiny of the Internet over the next decades, argue Goldsmith and Wu, will reflect the interests of powerful nations and the conflicts within and between them. While acknowledging the many attractions of the earliest visions of the Internet, the authors describe the new order, and speaking to both its surprising virtues and unavoidable vices. Far from destroying the Internet, the experience of the last decade has lead to a quiet rediscovery of some of the oldest functions and justifications for territorial government. While territorial governments have unavoidable problems, it has proven hard to replace what legitimacy governments have, and harder yet to replace the system of rule of law that controls the unchecked evils of anarchy. While the Net will change some of the ways that territorial states govern, it will not diminish the oldest and most fundamental roles of government and challenges of governance. Well written and filled with fascinating examples, including colorful portraits of many key players in Internet history, this is a work that is bound to stir heated debate in the cyberspace community.","author":[{"family":"Goldsmith","given":"Jack"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Tim"}],"ISBN":"978-0-19-803480-3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,3,17]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"239","publisher":"Oxford University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Who Controls the Internet?: Illusions of a Borderless World","title-short":"Who Controls the Internet?","type":"book"},

Not enough attention has been paid, however, to a more immediate danger—that the United States and a weaker China will find themselves locked in a crisis that could escalate to open military conflict. The long-term prospect for a new great power rivalry ultimately rests on uncertain forecasts about big shifts in national capabilities and debatable claims about the motivations of the two countries. By contrast, the danger of crisis instability involving these two nuclear-armed states is a tangible near-term concern. An analysis that examines the current state of U.S.-China relations and compares it with key aspects of U.S.-Soviet relations during the Cold War indicates that a serious Sino-American crisis may be more likely and more dangerous than expected. The capabilities each side possesses, and specific features of the most likely scenarios for U.S.-China crises, suggest reasons to worry that escalation pressures will exist and that they will be highest early in a crisis, compressing the time frame for diplomacy to avert military conflict.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Goldstein","given":"Avery"}],"container-title":"International Security","container-title-short":"International Security","DOI":"10.1162/ISEC_a_00114","ISSN":"0162-2889","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,4,1]]},"page":"49-89","source":"mitpressjournals.org (Atypon)","title":"First Things First: The Pressing Danger of Crisis Instability in U.S.-China Relations","title-short":"First Things First","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/10.1162/ISEC_a_00114","volume":"37"},
  {"id":"goldstein_uschinanaval_2017","abstract":"A truism in strategic studies holds that warfare is highly complex and unpredictable. What appears to be a stable and predictable military balance can be suddenly overthrown by innovative doctrines or cunning strategies. This paper attempts to fill a perceived gap in strategic studies analysis with respect to US–China naval conflict scenarios. The author is concerned that most Western analyses on the subject tend to be simplistic and unduly optimistic. The approach in this paper follows a “Chinese style” in that it examines the Asia-Pacific strategic balance as a series of interacting military campaigns. The results of the analysis yield that the US retains a strong advantage in certain warfare domains, to be sure. Yet, the assumption that the US military has a decisive advantage in the relevant scenarios becomes dubious in light of the potentially devastating blow against US and allied bases that could be made by PLA conventional missile forces. Moreover, a Chinese advantage in the use of offensive mine warfare, when combined with China's ability to prevent US and allied aerial anti-submarine forces from flying, could combine to roll back, or at least significantly limit, Washington's heretofore decisive undersea advantage.\n         , \n            \n            在战略理论而言, 战争的进程是非常复杂和不可预测的。一个似乎稳定和可预测的军事平衡能突然被创新军事教义或灵巧的策略推翻。本文试图填补中美海上军事冲突的战略研究。作者认为, 大多数西方分析人对这个问题的判断往往是简单或过于乐观的。本文采用“中国式”方式将亚太战略平衡作为一系列相互影响的军事行动。 分析结果表明, 美国在某些战争领域仍然保留强大的优势。然而,鉴于中国常规导弹可能造成对美国与盟国的潜在破坏性打击,美军在有关情况下具有所谓决定性优势的假设存有相当多的疑点。 此外,解放军在使用进攻性水雷战争方面的优势,与中国在防止美国和盟军在空中反潜部队飞行的能力,也有望被结合起来对抗美国军事实力,或至少大大削减美军水下作战的决定性优势。 在这种情况下,中美海军对抗的最终结果似乎还是一个未知数。","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Goldstein","given":"Lyle"}],"container-title":"The China Quarterly","DOI":"10.1017/S030574101700131X","ISSN":"0305-7410, 1468-2648","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,12]]},"language":"en","page":"904-931","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"The US–China Naval Balance in the Asia-Pacific: An Overview","title-short":"The US–China Naval Balance in the Asia-Pacific","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/china-quarterly/article/uschina-naval-balance-in-the-asiapacific-an-overview/96A3A78CFDF6E4C6ED690204593A12DF","volume":"232"},

While sound strategic thinking applies to all levels of warfare, the application of strategic concepts to low‐intensity conflict creates unique circumstances. An understanding of those circumstances is essential if the United States is to pursue a successful strategy at this level of warfare. The nature of limited war and the relationships between the political, military, and social structures of the adversaries create the bounds within which a successful strategy must operate.

Although taking place below the threshold of direct military confrontation, China’s assertiveness frequently involves coercive elements that put at risk existing rules and norms; physical control of disputed waters and territory; and the credibility of U.S. security commitments. Regional leaders have expressed increasing alarm that such “gray zone” coercion threatens to destabilize the region by increasing the risk of conflict and undermining the rules-based order. Yet, the United States and its allies and partners have struggled to develop effective counters to China’s maritime coercion.

  {"id":"greenhill_weaponsmassmigration_2010","abstract":"At first glance, the U.S. decision to escalate the war in Vietnam in the mid-1960s, China's position on North Korea's nuclear program in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and the EU resolution to lift what remained of the arms embargo against Libya in the mid-2000s would appear to share little in common. Yet each of these seemingly unconnected and far-reaching foreign policy decisions resulted at least in part from the exercise of a unique kind of coercion, one predicated on the intentional creation, manipulation, and exploitation of real or threatened mass population movements.\n\n\n\n\tIn Weapons of Mass Migration, Kelly M. Greenhill offers the first systematic examination of this widely deployed but largely unrecognized instrument of state influence. She shows both how often this unorthodox brand of coercion has been attempted (more than fifty times in the last half century) and how successful it has been (well over half the time). She also tackles the questions of who employs this policy tool, to what ends, and how and why it ever works. Coercers aim to affect target states' behavior by exploiting the existence of competing political interests and groups, Greenhill argues, and by manipulating the costs or risks imposed on target state populations.\n\n\n\n\tThis \"coercion by punishment\" strategy can be effected in two ways: the first relies on straightforward threats to overwhelm a target's capacity to accommodate a refugee or migrant influx; the second, on a kind of norms-enhanced political blackmail that exploits the existence of legal and normative commitments to those fleeing violence, persecution, or privation. The theory is further illustrated and tested in a variety of case studies from Europe, East Asia, and North America. To help potential targets better respond to—and protect themselves against—this kind of unconventional predation, Weapons of Mass Migration also offers practicable policy recommendations for scholars, government officials, and anyone concerned about the true victims of this kind of coercion—the displaced themselves.","author":[{"family":"Greenhill","given":"Kelly"}],"collection-title":"Cornell Studies in Security Affairs","event-place":"Ithaca, NY","ISBN":"978-1-5017-0436-9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,3,18]]},"publisher":"Cornell University Press","publisher-place":"Ithaca, NY","source":"Cornell University Press","title":"Weapons of Mass Migration: Forced Displacement, Coercion, and Foreign Policy","title-short":"Weapons of Mass Migration","type":"book"},
  {"id":"gurantz_fearappeasementeffectiveness_2017","abstract":"Governments often fear the future intentions of their adversaries. In this article we show how this fear can make deterrent threats credible under seemingly incredible circumstances. We consider a model in which a defender seeks to deter a transgression with both intrinsic and military value. We examine how the defender’s fear of the challenger’s future belligerence affects his willingness to respond to the transgression with war. We derive conditions under which even a very minor transgression effectively “tests” for the challenger’s future belligerence, which makes the defender’s deterrent threat credible even when the transgression is objectively minor and the challenger is ex ante unlikely to be belligerent. We also show that fear can actually benefit the defender by allowing her to credibly deter.

  {"id":"hainmueller_attitudeshighlyskilled_2010","abstract":"Past research has emphasized two critical economic concerns that appear to generate anti-immigrant sentiment among native citizens: concerns about labor market competition and concerns about the fiscal burden on public services. We provide direct tests of both models of attitude formation using an original survey experiment embedded in a nationwide U.S. survey. The labor market competition model predicts that natives will be most opposed to immigrants who have skill levels similar to their own. We find instead that both low-skilled and highly skilled natives strongly prefer highly skilled immigrants over low-skilled immigrants, and this preference is not decreasing in natives' skill levels. The fiscal burden model anticipates that rich natives oppose low-skilled immigration more than poor natives, and that this gap is larger in states with greater fiscal exposure (in terms of immigrant access to public services). We find instead that rich and poor natives are equally opposed to low-skilled immigration in general. In states with high fiscal exposure, poor (rich) natives are more (less) opposed to low-skilled immigration than they are elsewhere. This indicates that concerns among poor natives about constraints on welfare benefits as a result of immigration are more relevant than concerns among the rich about increased taxes. Overall the results suggest that economic self-interest, at least as currently theorized, does not explain voter attitudes toward immigration. The results are consistent with alternative arguments emphasizing noneconomic concerns associated with ethnocentrism or sociotropic considerations about how the local economy as a whole may be affected by immigration.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,5,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Hainmueller","given":"Jens"},{"family":"Hiscox","given":"Michael J."}],"container-title":"American Political Science Review","DOI":"10.1017/S0003055409990372","ISSN":"1537-5943","issue":"01","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,2]]},"page":"61–84","source":"Cambridge Journals Online","title":"Attitudes toward Highly Skilled and Low-skilled Immigration: Evidence from a Survey Experiment","title-short":"Attitudes toward Highly Skilled and Low-skilled Immigration","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0003055409990372","volume":"104"},

Often the United States confronts these problems as a zero-sum game in which the government and the insurgents compete for popular support and cooperation. The U.S. prescription for success has had two main elements: to support liberalizing, democratizing reforms to reduce popular grievances; and to pursue a military strategy that carefully targets insurgents while avoiding harming civilians. An analysis of contemporaneous documents and interviews with participants in three cases held up as models of the governance approach—Malaya, Dhofar, and El Salvador—shows that counterinsurgency success is the result of a violent process of state building in which elites contest for power, popular interests matter little, and the government benefits from uses of force against civilians.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Hazelton","given":"Jacqueline"}],"container-title":"International Security","container-title-short":"International Security","DOI":"10.1162/ISEC_a_00283","ISSN":"0162-2889","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,7,1]]},"page":"80-113","source":"MIT Press Journals","title":"The “Hearts and Minds” Fallacy: Violence, Coercion, and Success in Counterinsurgency Warfare","title-short":"The “Hearts and Minds” Fallacy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1162/ISEC_a_00283","volume":"42"},

We analyze fifty-eight cases and summarize previous findings that extended deterrence is likely to succeed when the immediate or short-term balance of forces favors the defender, when any previous crisis involving the same adversaries resulted in stalemate rather than clear victory for either, and when the military and diplomatic bargaining process is characterized by tit-for-tat or firm-but-flexible strategies rather than bullying or appeasement. The long-term balance of forces and the defender's possession of nuclear weapons make little difference. We then focus on cases where deterrence has failed and the defender must make a decision whether to fight. The defender is more likely to fight when the short-term balance of forces favors it, when it is bound to the third party by alliance ties or geographic proximity, and when it has followed a firm-but-flexible bargaining strategy during the crisis. Generally, these results emphasize the importance of different interests and perspectives of attackers and defenders. Even clear-sighted vision of its own interests may bring war if a state fails to tread a delicate balance between making credible threats and humiliating its adversary.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,9,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Huth","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Russett","given":"Bruce"}],"container-title":"International Studies Quarterly","container-title-short":"International Studies Quarterly","DOI":"10.2307/2600411","ISSN":"0020-8833","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[1988]]},"page":"29-45","source":"JSTOR","title":"Deterrence Failure and Crisis Escalation","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/2600411","volume":"32"},

The model is tested by probit analysis on a pooled time series of Great Power rival dyads from 1816 to 1975. The empirical results support the central hypothesis that the effects of the international system are mediated by the risk propensity of decision makers. In addition, the authors find that dyadic- and unit-level variables such as arms races, power transitions, and the current and past dispute behavior of rivals also have significant effects on conflict behavior.

I argue that military information campaigns fall short of expectations for two reasons. First, the theory of influence militaries generally embrace – communications as a non-lethal weapons system – is largely invalid. While treating information as a weapons system makes it easier to integrate it into the existing military planning system, this overstates the independent effects of communications on behavior and understates the importance of interactive effects of what commercial marketing theory refers to as the “marketing mix” – product, price, promotion, and placement. It would be more appropriate to treat military information operations as a form of marketing: a composite effort to induce a specific behavior in a target audience by applying a combination of material and ideational instruments. The marketing model suggests that the efficacy of information operations will depend not simply on the message and its delivery (promotion) but on the behavior the sender seeks to induce (the product), the costs of that behavior (the price), and the opportunities available for such behavior (the placement).","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,9,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Jackson","given":"Colin F."}],"container-title":"Journal of Strategic Studies","DOI":"10.1080/01402390.2016.1139496","ISSN":"0140-2390","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,3,7]]},"page":"1-27","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Information Is Not a Weapons System","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01402390.2016.1139496","volume":"0"},

The \"New York Times\" called it, in an article published nearly ten years after the book's appearance, \"the seminal statement of principles underlying political psychology.\" The perspective established by Jervis remains an important counterpoint to structural explanations of international politics, and from it has developed a large literature on the psychology of leaders and the problems of decision making under conditions of incomplete information, stress, and cognitive bias. Jervis begins by describing the process of perception (for example, how decision makers learn from history) and then explores common forms of misperception (such as overestimating one's influence). Finally, he tests his ideas through a number of important events in international relations from nineteenth- and twentieth-century European history. In a contemporary application of Jervis's ideas, some argue that Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990 in part because he misread the signals of American leaders with regard to the independence of Kuwait. Also, leaders of the United States and Iraq in the run-up to the most recent Gulf War might have been operating under cognitive biases that made them value certain kinds of information more than others, whether or not the information was true. Jervis proved that, once a leader believed something, that perception would influence the way the leader perceived all other relevant information. -- Publisher description.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,12,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Jervis","given":"Robert"}],"event-place":"Princeton, N.J","ISBN":"978-1-4008-7313-5 978-1-336-19996-5","issued":{"date-parts":[[1976]]},"language":"English","note":"OCLC: 905696205","publisher":"Princeton University Press","publisher-place":"Princeton, N.J","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Perception and misperception in international politics","type":"book","volume":"49"},

To improve this, this article reviews the current ways of approaching Russian warfare from post-independence to after Ukraine. Then, we investigate Russian warfare from the four spectrums of military, informational, economic, and energy, and from political influence operations. From this, we propose the concept of Full-Spectrum Conflict that captures the use of violent and non-violent means as well as the conduct of conflict in differing degrees of intensity from peace to war and the space in between. This remedies the problem of conceptualizing, and hopefully understanding, the conduct of Russian conflict.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,10,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Jonsson","given":"Oscar"},{"family":"Seely","given":"Robert"}],"container-title":"The Journal of Slavic Military Studies","DOI":"10.1080/13518046.2015.998118","ISSN":"1351-8046","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,1,2]]},"page":"1-22","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Russian Full-Spectrum Conflict: An Appraisal After Ukraine","title-short":"Russian Full-Spectrum Conflict","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13518046.2015.998118","volume":"28"},

The spread of nuclear weapons to South Asia offers an opportunity to investigate this crucial question.

Pessimistic scholars maintain that nuclear weapons make the subcontinent war-prone, because of technological, political, and organizational problems.

  {"id":"kelemen_lawfocalpoints_2014","abstract":"Many studies suggest that strict balanced budget rules can restrain sovereign debt and lower sovereign borrowing costs, even if those rules are never enforced in court. Why might public officials adhere to a rule that is practically never enforced in court? Existing literature points to a legal deterrence logic in which the threat of judicial enforcement deters sovereigns from violating the rules in the first place. By contrast, we argue that balanced budget rules work by coordinating decentralized punishment of sovereigns by bond markets, rather than by posing a credible threat of judicial enforcement. Therefore, the clarity of the focal point provided by the rule, rather than the strength of its judicial enforcement mechanisms, determines its effectiveness. We develop a formal model that captures the logic of our argument, and we assess this model using data on U.S. states. We then consider implications of our argument for the impact of the balanced budget rules recently imposed on eurozone states in the Fiscal Compact Treaty.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Kelemen","given":"R.

His vision of war has been enormously influential, through his service as senior counterinsurgency adviser to General David Petraeus during the Surge in Iraq, as special adviser to the United States Secretary of State, and as a current adviser to the United States, British, Australian and other allied governments. This brief book distills that vision in an easily readable and practical format, through a completely revised and updated edition of his 2006 cult classic \"The Twenty-Eight Articles\", a field practitioner's guide to the fundamentals of counterinsurgency, which has become the essential handbook for generations of allied military officers and civilian officials in Iraq and Afghanistan, has become part of the course of instruction at military academies and counterinsurgency schools worldwide, and has been translated into Arabic and Spanish. This edition presents a fully updated and expanded version, including a new introduction, annotated tactical case studies, and an appendix on the key principles of the hugely successful Surge campaign of 2007 in Iraq. Issued as a rugged, pocket-sized field handbook, this modern classic will be an indispensable aid to a new generation of field officers, as well as a concise and accessible primer for students and the general reader.","author":[{"family":"Kilcullen","given":"David"}],"ISBN":"978-1-84904-028-0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"251","publisher":"Hurst","source":"Google Books","title":"Counterinsurgency","type":"book"},

On the contrary, however, Clausewitz's understanding of the intensity of warfare, and its relationship with the political environment of any given time, makes his thinking compatible with changing historical circumstances. The current War on Terror, for example, can be comfortably accommodated within Clausewitz's concept of war. However, a move away from Clausewitz in US doctrine has been coupled with a rejection of LIC in favour of the erroneous notion of ‘operations other than war’.

  {"id":"korybko_hybridwarsindirect_2015","abstract":"Sputnik International’s political analyst and journalist, Andrew Korybko, just published his first book on “Hybrid Wars: The Indirect Adaptive Approach To Regime Change”. It was reviewed by the Diplomatic Academy of Russia and released with the assistance of the People’s Friendship University of Russia, where Andrew is a member of the expert council for the Institute of Strategic Research and Predictions. His detailed work proves that Color Revolutions are a new form of warfare engineered by the US, with everything from their organizational makeup to geopolitical application being guided by American strategists. But unlike earlier researchers who have touched upon the topic, Andrew takes his work even further and uses the latest examples of the War on Syria and EuroMaidan to argue that the US has deployed a second, more dangerous step to its regime change toolkit.Hybrid Wars, as he labels them, are when the US meshes its Color Revolution and Unconventional Warfare strategies together to create a unified toolkit for carrying out regime change in targeted states. When a Color Revolution attempt fails, as it miserably did in Syria in 2011, the backup plan is to roll out an Unconventional War that builds directly upon the former’s social infrastructure and organizing methods. In the case of EuroMaidan, Andrew cites Western news sources such as Newsweek magazine, the Guardian, and Reuters in reminding everyone that in the days immediately prior to the coup’s successful completion, Western Ukraine was in full-scale rebellion against the central government and the stage was set for an Unconventional Syrian-esque War in the heart of Eastern Europe. Had it not been for the sudden overthrow of President Yanukovich, the US was prepared to take the country down the path of the Syrian scenario, which would have been its second full-fledged application of Hybrid War.Andrew’s revolutionary research ultimately shows that it was the US, not Russia, which spearheaded the use of Hybrid Wars, and that given his proven findings, it’s irresponsible to even call Russia’s alleged involvement in the Ukrainian Crisis a ‘hybrid war’. In fact, the US is far ahead of any other country in practicing this new method of warfare, as no other state has attempted a Color Revolution thus far, let alone transitioned it into an Unconventional War when their initial regime change plans failed. While some many think that such occurrences are spontaneous and happenstance, Andrew documents how Hybrid Wars are not only created from the ground-up by the US, but how they’re specifically deployed in areas where they’d be most geostrategically advantageous for the promotion of its unipolar policies.Thus, not only does Andrew describe the very essence of Hybrid Wars, but the final part of his book forecasts where he believes they may happen next. He introduces the groundbreaking concept of the Color Arc, a contiguous line of states stretching from Hungary to Kyrgyzstan and where the waging of Hybrid Wars would most seriously damage Russia’s national interests. This is the first time that Color Revolutions have ever been analyzed through a geopolitical prism, and it brings forth a completely different way of looking at this weapon’s utilization. This new paradigm is absolutely essential for understanding the US’ new approach to regime change and the form, both physical and geopolitical, it’s expected to take in the forthcoming years.","author":[{"family":"Korybko","given":"Andrew"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"159","source":"Amazon","title":"Hybrid Wars: The Indirect Adaptive Approach To Regime Change","title-short":"Hybrid Wars","type":"book"},

We present the first quantitative analysis of the relationship between cyber activities and physical violence during war. Using new event data from the armed conflict in Ukraine—and additional data from Syria’s civil war—we analyze the dynamics of cyber attacks and find that such activities have had little or no impact on fighting. In Ukraine—one of the first armed conflicts where both sides deployed such tools extensively—cyber activities failed to compel discernible changes in battlefield behavior. Indeed, hackers on both sides have had difficulty responding to battlefield events, much less shaping them. An analysis of conflict dynamics in Syria produces similar results: the timing of cyber actions is independent of fighting on the ground.

Beginning from a nuclear brinkmanship theory framework, I develop a new theory of nuclear crisis outcomes, which links nuclear superiority to victory in nuclear crises precisely through its effect on the balance of resolve. Using a new data set on fifty-two nuclear crisis dyads, I show that states that enjoy nuclear superiority over their opponents are more likely to win nuclear crises. I also find some support for the idea that political stakes shape crisis outcomes. These findings hold even after controlling for conventional military capabilities and for selection into nuclear crises.

  {"id":"kugler_warphenomenonworking_1990","abstract":"Wars have many common characteristics yet, like cancers, a general diagnosis is difficult because symptoms differ markedly. Systemic approaches are useful because they determine under what circumstances crises—the necessary preconditions for wars—may escalate into limited or major wars. This systemic diagnostic tool is particularly important in the nuclear era because the consequences of major war have been exponentially magnified. To illustrate how a systemic perspective provides a guide to the absence of major conflict since 1945, the power transition is used to anticipate the decline of the USSR, to provide insights regarding the peaceful unification of Germany, to account for the non‐conflictual integration of Europe and to explore the rise of Japan. Such developments are not dangerous to peace because they did not challenge the dominant power or the status quo. Also illustrated, however, are similar movements in different environment that may result in conflict. If these or other systemic insights continue to be supported by evidence, they can make a fundamental contribution to our understanding of how to avert major war in the nuclear era.

The resulting hierarchies have significant effects on the foreign policies of states as well as patterns of international conflict and cooperation. Focusing largely on U.S.-led hierarchies in the contemporary world, Lake provides a compelling account of the origins, functions, and limits of political order in the modern international system. The book is a model of clarity in theory, research design, and the use of evidence.Motivated by concerns about the declining international legitimacy of the United States following the Iraq War, Hierarchy in International Relations offers a powerful analytic perspective that has important implications for understanding America's position in the world in the years ahead.","author":[{"family":"Lake","given":"David"}],"ISBN":"978-0-8014-7715-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"232","publisher":"Cornell University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Hierarchy in International Relations","type":"book"},
  {"id":"lall_howmultipleimputation_2017","abstract":"Political scientists increasingly recognize that multiple imputation represents a superior strategy for analyzing missing data to the widely used method of listwise deletion. However, there has been little systematic investigation of how multiple imputation affects existing empirical knowledge in the discipline. This article presents the first large-scale examination of the empirical effects of substituting multiple imputation for listwise deletion in political science.

  {"id":"lanoszka_russianhybridwarfare_2016","abstract":"Russia's use of force against Ukraine since early 2014 has prompted some observers to remark that it is engaging in ‘hybrid warfare’. This form of military statecraft has made other former Soviet republics, such as the Baltic countries, fear that Russia would use subversion rather than pursue a conventional military engagement against them. Despite this concern about Russian hybrid war, existing descriptions of this form of war suffer from conceptual weaknesses. In this article hybrid warfare is conceived as a strategy that marries conventional deterrence and insurgency tactics. That is, the belligerent uses insurgent tactics against its target while using its conventional military power to deter a strong military response. The article then outlines why some former Soviet republics are susceptible to Russian hybrid warfare, allowing it to postulate inductively the conditions under which hybrid warfare might be used in general. The analysis yields two policy implications. First, military solutions are not wholly appropriate against hybrid warfare since it exploits latent ethnic grievances and weak civil societies. Second, only under narrow circumstances would belligerents resort to hybrid warfare. Belligerents need to be revisionist and militarily stronger than their targets, but they also need to have ethnic or linguistic ties with the target society to leverage in waging hybrid warfare.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,11,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Lanoszka","given":"Alexander"}],"container-title":"International Affairs","container-title-short":"International Affairs","DOI":"10.1111/1468-2346.12509","ISSN":"1468-2346","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,1]]},"language":"en","page":"175-195","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Russian hybrid warfare and extended deterrence in eastern Europe","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-2346.12509/abstract","volume":"92"},

Insecurity pervades Europe while NATO is in crisis with a Russia justifiably aggrieved by broken promises and the overreach of liberal hegemony. This insecurity is especially troubling because NATO’s newer commitments are indefensible. In this essay, I evaluate these criticisms of NATO enlargement and advance three claims. First, intentionally or not, NATO enlargement has fulfilled a reasonable need to hedge against Russian resurgence. Critics of NATO enlargement themselves conceded that Russia could become revisionist once it reconstitutes itself. Second, NATO enlargement still allows for mutually beneficial cooperation with Russia. It has not been responsible for Russia’s internal political development and aggressive foreign policy choices. Finally, NATO enlargement does not necessitate expensive deterrence measures to secure its most vulnerable members. NATO enlargement thus has hugely benefited European security.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Lanoszka","given":"Alexander"}],"container-title":"International Politics","DOI":"10.1057/s41311-020-00234-8","ISSN":"1384-5748","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"en","source":"www.readcube.com","title":"Thank goodness for NATO enlargement","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1057/s41311-020-00234-8"},

The authors ofOn Limited Nuclear War in the 21st Century argue that a time may come when one of these states makes the conscious decision that using a nuclear weapon against the United States, its allies, or forward deployed forces in the context of a crisis or a regional conventional conflict may be in its interests. They assert that we are unprepared for these types of limited nuclear wars and that it is urgent we rethink the theory, policy, and implementation of force related to our approaches to this type of engagement.  Together they critique Cold War doctrine on limited nuclear war and consider a number of the key concepts that should govern our approach to limited nuclear conflict in the future. These include identifying the factors likely to lead to limited nuclear war, examining the geopolitics of future conflict scenarios that might lead to small-scale nuclear use, and assessing strategies for crisis management and escalation control. Finally, they consider a range of strategies and operational concepts for countering, controlling, or containing limited nuclear war.","author":[{"family":"Larsen","given":"Jeffrey"},{"family":"Kartchner","given":"Kerry"}],"ISBN":"978-0-8047-9091-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,4,2]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"309","publisher":"Stanford University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"On Limited Nuclear War in the 21st Century","type":"book"},

They generally assume that would-be initiators are (1) instrumentally rational; (2) risk-prone gain-maximizers; (3) free of domestic constraints; and (4) able to identify themselves correctly as defenders or challengers. These assumptions are contradicted by empirical studies that indicate that risk-prone, gain-maximizing initiators are relatively uncommon; that leaders at times calculate as deterrence theories expect, but behave contrary to their predictions; and that the calculus of initiators generally depends on factors other than those identified by deterrence theories. Deductive theories of deterrence are also inadequate because they do not define their scope conditions. Nor can they accommodate deviation by initiators from processes of rational calculation.

The analytical distinction between “big” war and “little” war is excessively vague and devoid of empirical content, and it begs the more important question of what typologies of wars (if any) are most useful for the purposes of theory construction. Moreover, the relative utility of a single or separate theories depends on the specific question one wishes to answer, on the theory one constructs for that purpose, and on the tradeoffs one is willing to make among different criteria of theory evaluation. The tradeoffs between the parsimony and analytic power of a theory and its descriptive accuracy and predictive power are particularly important. These tradeoffs cannot be made in the abstract, for they require an evaluation of the degree of empirical support of each theory as well as its analytic power.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,9,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Levy","given":"Jack S."}],"container-title":"International Interactions","container-title-short":"International Interactions","DOI":"10.1080/03050629008434757","ISSN":"0305-0629","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[1990,12,1]]},"page":"215-224","source":"tandfonline.com (Atypon)","title":"Big wars, little wars, and theory construction","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03050629008434757","volume":"16"},

The work argues that many of the problems encountered in the development of deterrence theory lay in the fact that it was developed during the Cold War, when the immediate problem it had to address was how to prevent catastrophic nuclear wars. The logic of nuclear deterrence compelled a preoccupation with the problem of stability over credibility; however, because the logic of conventional deterrence is different, the solution of the tension between credibility and stability is achieved by deference to credibility, due to the requirements of reputation and costly signaling.  This book aims to narrow the gap between theory and evidence. It explores how a reconceptualization of the theory as a process that culminates in the internalization of deterrence within enduring rivalries is better suited to account for its final success: a finding that has eluded deterrence theorists for long.

Despite increased MOOTW participation throughout Asia, scant attention has been paid to the broader strategic implications of these operations. This article proposes a hypothesis in which MOOTW participation exacerbates security competition by revealing military capabilities and providing states with skills that make offensive action easier.

Yet the specific features of deterrence and compellence constantly change in accordance with historical development. In our own lifetimes, for instance, the rising significance of non-state actors and the increasing influence of regional powers have dramatically transformed international politics since the height of the Cold War. Yet much of the existing literature on deterrence and compellence continues to draw, whether implicitly or explicitly, upon assumptions and precepts formulated in a state-centric, bipolar world. Although contemporary coercion frequently features multiple coercers targeting state and non-state adversaries with non-military instruments of persuasion, most literature on coercion still focuses primarily on cases where a single state is trying to coerce another single state via traditional military means. In The Power to Hurt, the leading international relations scholars Kelly M. Greenhill and Peter Krause have gathered together an eminent cast of contributors (e.g., Bob Art, Dan Drezner, Alex Downes, Erik Gartzke, and others) to produce what promises to be a field-shaping work on one of IR's most essential subjects: coercion, whether in the form of compellence, deterrence, or a mix of the two.

Combining archival research on counterinsurgency campaigns in Vietnam and Kenya with the author's personal experience as a civilian advisor to the military in Iraq and Afghanistan, The Soul of Armies demonstrates that the US Army has persistently conducted counterinsurgency operations in a very different way from either the US Marine Corps or the British Army. These differences in conduct have serious consequences, affecting the likelihood of success, the potential for civilian casualties and collateral damage, and the ability to effectively support host nation governments.

For external powers such wars are necessarily “limited,” which constrains escalation above certain levels. With no direct survival interest at stake, fighting the war does not take automatic priority over the pursuit of other social, political, and economic objectives. Prosecuting the war consumes resources—economic, human, and political—which are thus not available for the pursuit of these other objectives. In the absence of a quick victory this creates the potential for those political divisions which historically have shifted the balance of forces in the metropolis in favor of withdrawal. For the insurgents, the fact of invasion and occupation generates cohesion, minimizes constraints on mobilization, and maximizes the willingness to incur costs. Precisely the opposite effects tend to characterize the war effort of the external power.

However, there has been little sustained attempt to assess structural causes and the arguments about the changing aims of contemporary warfare. This paper provides a critical analysis of the macro sociological accounts of the new war paradigm with a spotlight on the purpose and causes of the recent wars. The author argues that despite the development of elaborate models, the sociology of contemporary warfare rests on shaky foundations and hence fails to convince. Rather than witnessing a dramatic shift in the causes and objectives of contemporary violent conflict, one encounters a significant transformation in the social and historical context in which these wars are waged.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,9,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Malešević","given":"Siniša"}],"container-title":"International Political Sociology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1749-5687.2008.00038.x","ISSN":"1749-5687","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"97-112","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The Sociology of New Wars?

Second, these firms were more likely to allow government-affiliated auditors to examine their factories. Third, treated firms demonstrated greater compliance on the factory floor.

  {"id":"maoz_powercapabilitiesparadoxical_1989","abstract":"It has been persistently demonstrated that military superior states that are engaged in wars with militarily inferior ones may end up on the losing side. Unlike the processes by which military capabilities are converted into control over resources, the so-called \"paradoxical conflict outcomes\" phenomenon is more severe than a lack of correspondence between control over resources and control over outcomes. The paradox of power involves cases in which increased control over resources actually causes reduced control over outcomes. Several of the theoretical examples of this paradox are taken from social choice theory. These examples are applied to the analysis of the outcome of the Balkan Wars of 1912-1913 and of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982. The implications of the power paradox for theories of international politics are briefly discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,2,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Maoz","given":"Zeev"}],"container-title":"World Politics","DOI":"10.2307/2010410","ISSN":"0043-8871","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[1989]]},"page":"239-266","source":"JSTOR","title":"Power, Capabilities, and Paradoxical Conflict Outcomes","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/2010410","volume":"41"},

  {"id":"markowitz_goingdistanceprice_2013","abstract":"The central purpose of this article is to establish the relationship between power projection, technology, and economic power. How economically powerful does a state need to be before it can afford the capital intensive technologies, foreign bases, and military and logistical forces associated with global power projection? The specific research question we focus on in this article is: What determines how far states send their military forces? We argue that as the costs associated with projecting power decrease or as the wealth necessary to project power increases, states will project power more frequently and at greater distances. We use a system level time series analysis from 1870–1936 and a dispute level analysis on all militarized international disputes from 1870–2000 to test these propositions. This article is the first to demonstrate empirically that the distance and frequency of power projection is a function of the cost of projecting power. We close with a discussion of contemporary states building power projection capabilities and how future research might build from our research to explain this behavior.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,2,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Markowitz","given":"Jonathan N."},{"family":"Fariss","given":"Christopher J."}],"container-title":"International Interactions","DOI":"10.1080/03050629.2013.768458","ISSN":"0305-0629","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,4,1]]},"page":"119-143","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Going the Distance: The Price of Projecting Power","title-short":"Going the Distance","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03050629.2013.768458","volume":"39"},

  {"id":"matlary_partnersmembersnato_2014","abstract":"In this chapter, I discuss the importance of burden-sharing partnerships with NATO as a development that is, as I argue, symptomatic of the evolution of the Alliance into becoming an arena or platform for coalitions of the ‘willing and able’. After the end of the Cold War, we live in an era where armed attacks against one or several Alliance members, obliging others to respond immediately (although not necessarily by military means), have become rare and unlikely. As a result, the organization has increasingly turned into a ‘two-tiered’ or ‘multi-tiered’ alliance. Current operations are mostly Article 4 and hence, unlike Article 5 cases, voluntary. This implies that partners, as well as members, may contribute. Moreover, few members seem to be willing and able to make a contribution,1 something that inter alia the Libya operation has shown — only eight allies were actually willing to contribute combat capabilities. In other operations, like ISAF, all members contribute, but only a few with risk-willing capabilities. All ‘show the flag’, but few are willing and able to contribute to sharp operations that require top skill and risk-willingness.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,11,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Matláry","given":"Janne Haaland"}],"collection-title":"New Security Challenges Series","container-title":"NATO’s Post-Cold War Politics: The Changing Provision of Security","DOI":"10.1057/9781137330307_14","editor":[{"family":"Mayer","given":"Sebastian"}],"event-place":"London","ISBN":"978-1-137-33030-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"language":"en","page":"251-266","publisher":"Palgrave Macmillan UK","publisher-place":"London","source":"Springer Link","title":"Partners versus Members?

  {"id":"mazarr_masteringgrayzone_2015","abstract":"Discussions of an emerging practice of “gray zone” conflict have become increasingly common throughout the U.S. Army and the wider national security community, but the concept remains ill-defined and poorly understood. This monograph aims to contribute to the emerging dialogue about competition and rivalry in the gray zone by defining the term, comparing and contrasting it with related theories, and offering tentative hypotheses about this increasingly important form of state competition. The idea of operating gradually and somewhat covertly to remain below key thresholds of response is hardly new. Many approaches being used today—such as support for proxy forces and insurgent militias—have been employed for millennia. The monograph argues that the emergence of this more coherent and intentional form of gray zone conflict is best understood as the confluence of three factors. Understood in this context, gray zone strategies can be defined as a form of conflict that pursues political objectives through integrated campaigns; employs mostly nonmilitary or nonkinetic tools; strives to remain under key escalatory or red line thresholds to avoid outright conventional conflict; and moves gradually toward its objectives rather than seeking conclusive results in a relatively limited period of time. Having examined the scope and character of gray zone conflict, the monograph offers seven hypotheses about this emerging form of rivalry. Finally, the monograph offers recommendations for the United States and its friends and allies to deal with this challenge.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,7,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Mazarr","given":"Michael"}],"event-place":"Strategic Studies Institute","genre":"Research Report","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,2,2]]},"publisher":"US Army War College","publisher-place":"Strategic Studies Institute","title":"Mastering the Gray Zone: Understanding a Changing Era of Conflict","type":"report"},

We show that sanctions can be used to smooth shifts in relative power that would otherwise lead to preventive war. After presenting a model of shifting relative power and sanctions, we discuss two cases in which sanctions were imposed to destroy an adversary’s military capability. We also explore the implications of this argument for the evaluation of sanctions’ effectiveness. Because sanctions may be deployed as a mechanism to lock in the status quo rather than revise it, the outcome of a sanctions episode must be compared to its counterfactual rather than the status quo ante. Our argument suggests that sanctions may be effectively deployed in response to expected adverse shifts in relative power; therefore observed outcomes disadvantageous to the sanctioning state are insufficient proof that sanctions have failed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,21]]},"author":[{"family":"McCormack","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Pascoe","given":"Henry"}],"container-title":"Journal of Conflict Resolution","container-title-short":"Journal of Conflict Resolution","DOI":"10.1177/0022002715620471","ISSN":"0022-0027","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1711-1739","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Sanctions and Preventive War","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0022002715620471","volume":"61"},

It argues that the apparent peace among democratic states that emerges in the aftermath of World War I is not caused by domestic institutional attributes normally associated with democracy. Instead, this peace is an artifact of historically specific great power settlements. These settlements shape subsequent aggregate patterns of military conflict by altering the organizational configuration of the system in three critical ways—by creating new states, by altering hierarchical orders, and by influencing regime type in states. These claims are defended with a series of tests that show first how the statistical relationship between democracy and peace has exhibited substantial variation across great power orders; second, that this statistical relationship breaks down with theoretically motivated research design changes; and third, that great powers foster peace and similar regime types within their hierarchical orders. In short, the relationship between democracy and peace is spurious. The international political order is still built and managed by great powers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,5,11]]},"author":[{"family":"McDonald","given":"Patrick J."}],"container-title":"International Organization","DOI":"10.1017/S0020818315000120","ISSN":"0020-8183, 1531-5088","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,7]]},"page":"557-588","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Great Powers, Hierarchy, and Endogenous Regimes: Rethinking the Domestic Causes of Peace","title-short":"Great Powers, Hierarchy, and Endogenous Regimes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-organization/article/great-powers-hierarchy-and-endogenous-regimes-rethinking-the-domestic-causes-of-peace/4512AB956B5CB6ECB0E3851FBDFB70A3","volume":"69"},

  {"id":"mueller_reportinvestigationrussian_2019","abstract":"This document contains both Volumes I and II of the Mueller Report. From the Introduction to Volume I: As set forth in detail in this report, the Special Counsel's investigation established that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election principally through two operations. First, a Russian entity carried out a social media campaign that favored presidential candidate Donald J. Trump and disparaged presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Second, a Russian intelligence service conducted computer-intrusion operations against entities, employees, and volunteers working on the Clinton Campaign and then released stolen documents. The investigation also identified numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump Campaign. Although the investigation established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and that the Campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts, the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities. From the Introduction to Volume II: Beginning in 2017, the President of the United States took a variety of actions towards the ongoing investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election and related matters that raised questions about whether he had obstructed justice.

Differences were of degree rather than essence. During the interwar period, however, the armed forces grew increasingly asymmetrical, developing different approaches to the same problems. This study of major military innovations in the 1920s and 1930s explores differences in exploitation by the seven major military powers. The comparative essays investigate how and why innovation occurred or did not occur, and explain much of the strategic and operative performance of the Axis and Allies in World War II.

  {"id":"nagl_learningeatsoup_2005","abstract":"Invariably, armies are accused of preparing to fight the previous war. In Learning to Eat Soup with a Knife, Lieutenant Colonel John A. Nagl--a veteran of both Operation Desert Storm and the current conflict in Iraq--considers the now-crucial question of how armies adapt to changing circumstances during the course of conflicts for which they are initially unprepared. Through the use of archival sources and interviews with participants in both engagements, Nagl compares the development of counterinsurgency doctrine and practice in the Malayan Emergency from 1948 to 1960 with what developed in the Vietnam War from 1950 to 1975.  In examining these two events, Nagl--the subject of a recent New York Times Magazine cover story by Peter Maass--argues that organizational culture is key to the ability to learn from unanticipated conditions, a variable which explains why the British army successfully conducted counterinsurgency in Malaya but why the American army failed to do so in Vietnam, treating the war instead as a conventional conflict. Nagl concludes that the British army, because of its role as a colonial police force and the organizational characteristics created by its history and national culture, was better able to quickly learn and apply the lessons of counterinsurgency during the course of the Malayan Emergency.  With a new preface reflecting on the author's combat experience in Iraq, Learning to Eat Soup with a Knife is a timely examination of the lessons of previous counterinsurgency campaigns that will be hailed by both military leaders and interested civilians.","author":[{"family":"Nagl","given":"John"}],"ISBN":"978-0-226-56770-9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"286","publisher":"University of Chicago Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Learning to Eat Soup with a Knife: Counterinsurgency Lessons from Malaya and Vietnam","title-short":"Learning to Eat Soup with a Knife","type":"book"},

  {"id":"noetzel_doesmultitiernato_2009","abstract":"This year NATO will celebrate its 60th anniversary. So far the world's most powerful military alliance has been a remarkable success story. However, as the first decade of the new century draws to a close there appears to be a widening strategic rift among the allies. ‘Two-tier NATO’ is by now an established piece of shorthand in international strategic debate to indicate an ‘alliance à la carte’ divided into two or more factions of member states with divergent interests. Evidently, the alliance increasingly struggles to reach consensus on a whole range of strategic issues. So is NATO on a path to disintegration and, ultimately, to failure? This article argues that the organization has developed from a fixed ‘two-tier’ into a rather fluid ‘multi-tier’ alliance. On many issues the alliance is in fact divided into several different camps that are pushing in different directions. Thus, allies can be grouped into one of three tiers: a ‘reformist’, a ‘status-quo’ and a ‘reversal’-oriented one. While the evolution of such a multi-tier alliance will not inevitably result in NATO's demise unmanaged, this manifestation of camps will continuously disrupt the organization's strategic agility. The article finds that if NATO is to maintain strategic vitality, it needs to develop new institutional mechanisms and establish a consensus on its strategic posture in the changing international order and to make ‘variable geometry’ work.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,11,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Noetzel","given":"Timo"},{"family":"Schreer","given":"Benjamin"}],"container-title":"International Affairs","DOI":"10.1111/j.1468-2346.2009.00790.x","ISSN":"1468-2346","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"211-226","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Does a multi-tier NATO matter?

  {"id":"nye_deterrencedissuasioncyberspace_2017","abstract":"Understanding deterrence and dissuasion in cyberspace is often difficult because our minds are captured by Cold War images of massive retaliation to a nuclear attack by nuclear means. The analogy to nuclear deterrence is misleading, however, because many aspects of cyber behavior are more like other behaviors, such as crime, that states try (imperfectly) to deter. Preventing harm in cyberspace involves four complex mechanisms: threats of punishment, denial, entanglement, and norms. Even when punishment is used, deterrent threats need not be limited to cyber responses, and they may address general behavior as well as specific acts. Cyber threats are plentiful, often ambiguous, and difficult to attribute. Problems of attribution are said to limit deterrence and dissuasion in the cyber domain, but three of the major means—denial by defense, entanglement, and normative taboos—are not strongly hindered by the attribution problem. The effectiveness of different mechanisms depends on context, and the question of whether deterrence works in cyberspace depends on “who and what.” Not all cyberattacks are of equal importance; not all can be deterred; and not all rise to the level of significant national security threats. The lesson for policymakers is to focus on the most important attacks and to understand the context in which such attacks may occur and the full range of mechanisms available to prevent them.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,2,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Nye","given":"Joseph"}],"container-title":"International Security","container-title-short":"International Security","DOI":"10.1162/ISEC_a_00266","ISSN":"0162-2889","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,1,1]]},"page":"44-71","source":"MIT Press Journals","title":"Deterrence and Dissuasion in Cyberspace","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/ISEC_a_00266","volume":"41"},

Beck et al. (1998) address the effect of temporal dependence in the time-series data on empirical support for the liberal peace, while Barbieri (1998) makes a number of important changes in theoretical specification and measurement. Using data for nearly the entire post-World War II era (1950-92), we first replicate the specifications of the challengers. When analyzing all dyads, we find no relationship between interdependence and peace, but the pacific benefits of trade become evident among the politically relevant dyads (those including a major power, or two contiguous states), among whom the great majority of disputes occur. Subsequently, we introduce, in stages, an alternative method of controlling for temporal dependence, our theoretically preferred measures of interdependence and proximity, and new dyadic estimates for unreported trade. With these sequential modifications we find increasingly strong support for the liberals' belief that economic interdependence and democracy have important pacific benefits. This support is largely robust to the methods of controlling for temporal dependence and to whether an attempt is made to explain involvement in disputes or merely their onset. We find no evidence that asymmetric trade increases conflict.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,1,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Oneal","given":"John R."},{"family":"Russett","given":"Bruce"}],"container-title":"Journal of Peace Research","container-title-short":"Journal of Peace Research","DOI":"10.1177/0022343399036004003","ISSN":"0022-3433","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[1999,7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"423-442","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Assessing the Liberal Peace with Alternative Specifications: Trade Still Reduces Conflict","title-short":"Assessing the Liberal Peace with Alternative Specifications","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0022343399036004003","volume":"36"},

  {"id":"pearlman_triadiccoercionisrael_2018","abstract":"In the post–Cold War era, states increasingly find themselves in conflicts with nonstate actors. Finding it difficult to fight these opponents directly, many governments instead target states that harbor or aid nonstate actors, using threats and punishment to coerce host states into stopping those groups.Wendy Pearlman and Boaz Atzili investigate this strategy, which they term triadic coercion. They explain why states pursue triadic coercion, evaluate the conditions under which it succeeds, and demonstrate their arguments across seventy years of Israeli history. This rich analysis of the Arab-Israeli conflict, supplemented with insights from India and Turkey, yields surprising findings. Traditional discussions of interstate conflict assume that the greater a state’s power compared to its opponent, the more successful its coercion. Turning that logic on its head, Pearlman and Atzili show that this strategy can be more effective against a strong host state than a weak one because host regimes need internal cohesion and institutional capacity to move against nonstate actors. If triadic coercion is thus likely to fail against weak regimes, why do states nevertheless employ it against them? Pearlman and Atzili’s investigation of Israeli decision-making points to the role of strategic culture.

Using a simple game-theoretic model, this essay offers a reformulation of the problem of absolute and relative gains that links changes in the states' behavior, the feasibility of cooperation, and especially the states' concern for relative versus absolute gains explicitly to changes in the constraints facing the states.

This paper shows that a common mechanism is at work in a number of these diverse studies. This common mechanism provides a more general formulation of a type of commitment problem that can arise in many different substantive settings. The present analysis then formalizes this mechanism as an “inefficiency condition” that ensures that all of the equilibria of a stochastic game are inefficient.

  {"id":"powell_nuclearbrinkmanshiplimited_2015","abstract":"An open question in nuclear deterrence theory is whether and how the balance of military power affects the dynamics of escalation. The balance of military strength plays virtually no role in standard accounts of brinkmanship. But this is largely by assumption and seems incompatible with an apparent trade-off between power and risk that decision makers have faced in some actual crises. This paper incorporates this trade-off in a modified model of nuclear brinkmanship. A main result is that the more likely the balance of resolve is to favor a defender, the less military power a challenger brings to bear. The model also formalizes the stability-instability paradox, showing that a less stable strategic balance, that is, a sharper trade-off between power and risk, makes conflict at high levels of violence less likely but conflict at lower levels more likely. The analysis also helps explain the incentives different states have to adopt different nuclear doctrines and force postures.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,8,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Powell","given":"Robert"}],"container-title":"International Organization","DOI":"10.1017/S0020818315000028","ISSN":"1531-5088","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,6]]},"page":"589–626","source":"Cambridge Journals Online","title":"Nuclear Brinkmanship, Limited War, and Military Power","type":"article-journal","volume":"69"},

This essay extends the formal analysis of deterrence theory to the strategy of limited retaliation in which states exert coercive pressure by inflicting limited amounts of damage in order to make the threat of future punishment more credible. This strategy is modeled as a game of sequential bargaining with incomplete information. The equilibria suggest that states prefer relatively smaller, less-destructive limited options; that counterforce options are desirable even if they cannot limit the total amount of damage an adversary can inflict; that smaller, less-destructive limited nuclear options may make a nuclear exchange more likely; and that uncertainty and incomplete information may significantly enhance deterrence.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,9,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Powell","given":"Robert"}],"container-title":"American Political Science Review","DOI":"10.2307/1962402","ISSN":"1537-5943, 0003-0554","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[1989,6]]},"page":"503-519","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Nuclear Deterrence and the Strategy of Limited Retaliation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/nuclear-deterrence-and-the-strategy-of-limited-retaliation/5023362D5268B87A26CA80CB6C97E62A","volume":"83"},

This article links these features to shifts in the distribution of power and to the fact that one of the functions of fighting is to forestall adverse shifts. The analysis centers on a simple model of state consolidation. The equilibrium displays these features: Fighting occurs when the distribution of power is shifting rapidly. The factions avoid fighting and cut deals when the distribution of power shifts slowly or is stable. Fighting resumes if the distribution of power again begins to shift rapidly. The analysis also shows that state consolidation can occur without fighting if the process is sufficiently slow.

  {"id":"powell_warcommitmentproblem_2006","abstract":"Although formal work on war generally sees war as a kind of bargaining\nbreakdown resulting from asymmetric information, bargaining\nindivisibilities, or commitment problems, most analyses have focused on\ninformational issues. But informational explanations and the models\nunderlying them have at least two major limitations: they often provide a\npoor account of prolonged conflict, and they give an odd reading of the\nhistory of some cases. This article describes these limitations and argues\nthat bargaining indivisibilities should really be seen as commitment\nproblems. The present analysis then shows that a common mechanism links\nthree important kinds of commitment problem: (1) preventive war, (2)\npreemptive attacks arising from first-strike or offensive advantages, and\n(3) conflicts resulting from bargaining over issues that affect future\nbargaining power. In each case, large, rapid shifts in the distribution of\npower can lead to war. Finally, the analysis elaborates a distinctly\ndifferent mechanism based on a comparison of the cost of deterring an\nattack on the status quo with the expected cost of trying to eliminate the\nthreat to the status quo.For helpful\ncomments and criticisms, I thank James Fearon, Hein Goemans, Lisa Martin,\n Sebastian Mazzuca, Branislav Slantchev, and seminar participants at the\nUniversity of Montreal–McGill Research Group in International\nSecurity, the Institute in Mathematical Behavioral Sciences, University of\nCalifornia, Irvine, and University of California, Santa Barbara.

This article explores the motivations behind voluntary credit claiming for the two main actors in cyberspace: states and politically-motivated nonstate actors. We argue that states are most likely to claim credit for their operations, and to do so privately, when the goal is to coerce an adversary. Nonstate actors, on the other hand, are likely to claim credit for most attacks and to do so publicly to showcase their capabilities, influence public opinion, and grow their ranks. We use case narratives to assess the plausibility of our argument and find strong support.

  {"id":"press_calculatingcredibilityhow_2007","abstract":"Calculating Credibility examines--and ultimately rejects--a fundamental belief held by laypeople and the makers of American foreign policy: the notion that backing down during a crisis reduces a country's future credibility. Fear of diminished credibility motivated America's costly participation in the Korean and Vietnam wars, and, since the end of the Cold War, this concern has continued to guide American policy decisions. Daryl G. Press uses historical evidence, including declassified documents, to answer two crucial questions: When a country backs down in a crisis, does its credibility suffer? How do leaders assess their adversaries' credibility? Press illuminates the decision-making processes behind events such as the crises in Europe that preceded World War II, the superpower showdowns over Berlin in the 1950s and 60s, and the Cuban Missile Crisis. When leaders face the prospect of high-stakes military conflicts, Press shows, they do not assess their adversaries' credibility by peering into their opponents' past and evaluating their history of keeping or breaking commitments. Power and interests in the current crisis--not past actions--determine the credibility of a threat. Press demonstrates that threats are credible only if backed by sufficient power and only if pursuing important interests. Press believes that Washington's obsession with the dangers of backing down has made U.S. foreign policy unnecessarily rigid. In every competitive environment--sports, gambling, warfare--competitors use feints and bluffs to tremendous advantage. Understanding the real sources of credibility, Press asserts, would permit a more flexible, and more effective, foreign policy.","author":[{"family":"Press","given":"Daryl G."}],"ISBN":"978-0-8014-7415-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"244","publisher":"Cornell University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Calculating Credibility: How Leaders Assess Military Threats","title-short":"Calculating Credibility","type":"book"},

Furthermore, extended deterrence theories have not modeled all three actors in extended deterrence situations. To overcome these limitations in the literature, the author develops the three-party extended deterrence game and analyzes it with both complete and incomplete information, allowing conclusions to be drawn regarding deterrence and the related areas of alliance reliability and war expansion. For example, the findings indicate that deterrence is most likely to succeed when the alliance between Defender and Protégé is reliable. However, neither Defender nor Protégé wishes to be a more reliable ally than the other; if there is an asymmetry in reliability, Challenger will chose the more reliable state to attack in order to avoid a multilateral war.

  {"id":"ray_explaininginterstateconflict_2003","abstract":"Most multivariate models designed by analysts of intemational conflict focus on one key explanatory factor and include several control variables. There are prominent norms or customs in the subfield of international politics regarding the construction of multivariate models and the selection of control variables. Several of these norms or customs may make the results of multivariate analyses confusing and difficult to interpret. Analysts typically do not, for example, distinguish between confounding and intervening variables even though the implications and impacts of such variables are substantially different. Most researchers also fail to distinguish between confounding variables and variables that have an impact on interstate conflict that is complementary to that of the key explanatory factor. Commonly, control variables are included in a model for no other reason than that they also have an impact on interstate conflict or some other outcome variable. In some recent analyses, \"independent\" variables are included that are related by definition to the key explanatory variable, or to each other. This practice introduces into multivariate models artifactual, misleading degrees of statistical association between variables related to each other by definition with tautological relationships masquerading as empirical causal connections that complicate the interpretation of results. Finally, the construction of pooled cross-sectional, time series analyses is consistently based on the assumption that the key explanatory factor, as well as the control variables, have essentially identical impacts on interstate conflict across space, and over time. Substantial evidence, some of which is provided in this paper, suggests that this assumption is unwarranted. This paper provides five guidelines for the construction of multivariate models that address these issues in a manner aimed at making the results of multivariate analyses more intelligible and credible.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Ray","given":"James Lee"}],"container-title":"Conflict Management and Peace Science","container-title-short":"Conflict Management and Peace Science","DOI":"10.1177/073889420302000201","ISSN":"0738-8942","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003,9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1-31","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Explaining Interstate Conflict and War: What Should Be Controlled for?","title-short":"Explaining Interstate Conflict and War","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/073889420302000201","volume":"20"},

Bill Davidow wrote an article entitled “The Tragedy of the Internet Commons” for The Atlantic in May 2012. Dominic Basulto wrote a blog entry for the Washington Post entitled “The ‘Doomsday’ Virus and the Tragedy of the Internet Commons” in July 2012. The notion of the Internet as a commons is also evident in the thinking of Internet activists and evangelists, perhaps most notably in the declaration of the Internet Society that “the Internet is for everyone.” Unfortunately, like many things that go viral, the idea of an Internet commons is also misleading. In its first section, this article will argue that the Internet does not possess key features associated with a commons, a concept drawn from the economics literature on the provision of public goods.

But as crafty as such so-called active measures have become, they are not new.In this astonishing journey through a century of secret psychological war, Rid reveals for the first time some of history's most significant operations - many of them nearly beyond belief. A White Russian ploy backfires and brings down a New York police commissioner; a KGB-engineered, anti-Semitic hate campaign creeps back across the Berlin Wall; the CIA backs a fake publishing empire, run by a former Wehrmacht U-boat commander that produces Germany's best jazz magazine.","author":[{"family":"Rid","given":"Thomas"}],"ISBN":"978-1-78283-460-1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,23]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"book","publisher":"Profile Books","source":"Google Books","title":"Active Measures: The Secret History of Disinformation and Political Warfare","title-short":"Active Measures","type":"book"},

Increasingly, scholars are using the Cold War concept of a stability-instability paradox to describe the possibility of Pyongyang being more willing to tolerate risk and conduct increased numbers of lower-level provocations under the cover of nuclear weapons. North Korea has long been tolerant of accepting a great deal of risk prior to its acquisition of nuclear weapons, and it is not clear if nuclear weapons have increased that tolerance––or as some have argued, it may actually decrease North Korea’s risk tolerance, making it more cautious. While North Korea’s rhetorical barrages in recent years have exceeded past outbursts, and weapons testing has done a great deal to rattle nerves, much of this can be viewed as part of its deterrence-posturing and less of the more aggressive, status quo-altering actions predicted by the stability-instability paradox.","author":[{"family":"Roehrig","given":"Terence"}],"container-title":"Korean Journal of Defense Analysis","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,6]]},"language":"en","page":"181-198","source":"Zotero","title":"North Korea, Nuclear Weapons, and the Stability-Instability Paradox","type":"article-journal","volume":"28"},

When do intelligence-policy relations work best? How do intelligence-policy failures influence threat assessment, military strategy, and foreign policy? These questions are at the heart of recent national security controversies, including the 9/11 attacks and the war in Iraq. In both cases the relationship between intelligence and policy broke down—with disastrous consequences.In Fixing the Facts, Joshua Rovner explores the complex interaction between intelligence and policy and shines a spotlight on the problem of politicization. Major episodes in the history of American foreign policy have been closely tied to the manipulation of intelligence estimates. Rovner describes how the Johnson administration dealt with the intelligence community during the Vietnam War; how President Nixon and President Ford politicized estimates on the Soviet Union; and how pressure from the George W. Bush administration contributed to flawed intelligence on Iraq. He also compares the U.S. case with the British experience between 1998 and 2003, and demonstrates that high-profile government inquiries in both countries were fundamentally wrong about what happened before the war.","author":[{"family":"Rovner","given":"Joshua"}],"ISBN":"978-0-8014-6313-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,7,26]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"276","publisher":"Cornell University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Fixing the Facts: National Security and the Politics of Intelligence","title-short":"Fixing the Facts","type":"book"},

  {"id":"russell_nuclearpeacefallacy_2003","abstract":"Some scholars counter-intuitively argue that the proliferation of nuclear weapons increases international security by substantially reducing the chances for inter-state armed conflict. This school of thought draws heavily on the history of the American-Soviet Cold War rivalry to inform its analysis. The security dilemmas in the contemporary Middle East and South Asia where numerous states have or want nuclear weapons, however, are profoundly different than the competition between the United States and the Soviet Union. States in the Middle East and South Asia today may see nuclear weapons as usable instruments of warfare in contrast to conventional wisdom in the West that views them as weapons of deterrence and last resort. As common sense would have it, American and Allied policy designed to stem the proliferation of nuclear weapons is prudent. American diplomatic intervention, moreover, in regional crises as a third party may be needed in the future in the Middle East and South Asia to lessen the risks of nuclear warfare. Nevertheless, American policy-makers are likely in the future to find themselves facing a nuclear-armed nation-state-or soon to be nuclear weapons-capable state-in a crisis and will have to grapple with the risks of pre-emptive or preventive military action.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,10,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Russell","given":"Richard"}],"container-title":"Journal of Strategic Studies","DOI":"10.1080/01402390308559311","ISSN":"0140-2390","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003,3,1]]},"page":"136-155","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"The Nuclear Peace Fallacy: How Deterrence Can Fail","title-short":"The Nuclear Peace Fallacy","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01402390308559311","volume":"26"},

In this increasingly complex world, how do issues such as global terrorism, missile defense, and the Indian-Pakistani conflict factor into the decisions states make about nuclear weapons? In 'The Spread of Nuclear Weapons - A Debate Renewed', two major international relations scholars resume their well-known dialogue about these important questions, as well as others. Kenneth Waltz, the dean of realist theory in international relations, expands on his argument that 'more may be better,' contending that new nuclear states will use their acquired nuclear capabilities to deter threats and preserve peace. Scott Sagan, the leading proponent of organizational theories in international politics, continues to make the counterpoint that 'more will be worse' - novice nuclear states lack adequate organizational controls over their new weapons, which makes for a high risk of either deliberate of accidental nuclear war. The global community has long been fascinated by - as well as terrified of - nuclear weapons. This short and engaging book is required reading for citizens and statesmen, as well as scholars and students.","author":[{"family":"Sagan","given":"Scott"},{"family":"Waltz","given":"Kenneth"}],"ISBN":"978-0-393-97747-9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"220","publisher":"Norton","source":"Google Books","title":"The Spread of Nuclear Weapons: A Debate Renewed","title-short":"The Spread of Nuclear Weapons","type":"book"},

We analyze factors determining external support for insurgent groups from a principal-agent perspective. We focus on both the supply side, that is, when states are willing to support insurgent groups in other states, and the demand side, that is, when groups are willing to accept such support, with the conditions that this may entail. We test our hypotheses using new disaggregated data on insurgent groups and foreign support. Our results indicate that external rebel support is influenced by characteristics of the rebel group as well as linkages between rebel groups and actors in other countries. More specifically, we find that external support is more likely for moderately strong groups where support is more likely to be offered and accepted, in the presence of transnational constituencies, international rivalries, and when the government receives foreign support.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,2,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Salehyan","given":"Idean"},{"family":"Gleditsch","given":"Kristian Skrede"},{"family":"Cunningham","given":"David E."}],"container-title":"International Organization","DOI":"10.1017/S0020818311000233","ISSN":"1531-5088, 0020-8183","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,10]]},"page":"709-744","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Explaining External Support for Insurgent Groups","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-organization/article/explaining-external-support-for-insurgent-groups/5BD53FA2D095F6B6283AEEC6DF895DDE","volume":"65"},

This evidence comes from documents recently declassified by the Clinton Presidential Library, the Defense Department, and the State Department because of appeals by the author. As President Bill Clinton repeatedly remarked, the two key questions about enlargement were when and how. The sources make apparent that, during a critical decisionmaking period twenty-five years ago, supporters of a relatively swift conferral of full membership to a narrow range of countries outmaneuvered proponents of a slower, phased conferral of limited membership to a wide range of states. Pleas from Central and Eastern European leaders, missteps by Russian President Boris Yeltsin, and victory by the pro-expansion Republican Party in the 1994 U.S. congressional election all helped advocates of full-membership enlargement to win. The documents also reveal the surprising impact of Ukrainian politics on this debate and the complex roles played by both Strobe Talbott, a U.S. ambassador and later deputy secretary of state, and Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister.

  {"id":"schneider_informationrevolutioninternational_2017","abstract":"Over the last twenty years, the digital technologies of the information revolution have fundamentally impacted the nature of modern warfare and introduced significant uncertainty about capabilities, intentions, and the limits of conflict. How do these digital advances and the explosion of cyber technologies on and off the battlefield impact international stability? Has the information revolution fundamentally altered crisis dynamics such that states are more likely to inadvertently or intentionally escalate crises to war? This dissertation utilizes a multi-article, multi-method format with case studies and experimental analysis to examine these questions. The first piece looks at military revolutions and international stability and argues that a capability/vulnerability paradox of military revolutions suggests de-stabilizing effects of the information revolution. The second article examines offense-defense in U.S. doctrine since the information revolution and finds that the information revolution technologies invested in by offensively minded doctrinaires has created a path-dependency for further offense dominance in the information revolution. Finally, the last piece analyzes data from six years of crisis wargaming to generalize U.S. decision-maker perceptions of escalation and cyber operations. Together, these pieces seek to solve fundamental policy questions about how cyberspace operations and technology may impact current and future crises and their potential for conflict eruption.

  {"id":"schneider_russiannucleardeescalation_2018","abstract":"Putin developed Russia’s nuclear strategy, which allows for the first use of nuclear weapons in conventional war, when he was secretary of the Russian National Security Council Staff. Russian nuclear doctrine allows for the first use of nuclear weapons in “regional or even a local” war. Starting in 1999, Russia began to simulate the first use of nuclear weapons in large, theater-war exercises. Since 2000, all large-scale Russian military exercises have reportedly featured simulations of limited Russian nuclear strikes. Russia characterizes the first use of nuclear weapons as “de-escalation” of aggression. There is an impressive body of evidence going back decades indicating that Soviet/Russia’s threshold of nuclear weapons first use is lower than what was publicly announced. Indeed, in 2014, General of the Army (ret.) Yuri Baluyevskiy, who managed the development of Russia’s nuclear doctrine, said that the “conditions for pre-emptive nuclear strikes…is contained in classified policy documents.” Since 2007, Russia has made numerous high-level overt nuclear threats, including, since 2014, nuclear threats relating to Ukraine and the Baltics. Putin is preparing for a major war with the U.S. and NATO. He clearly hopes the West will capitulate without one. If he miscalculates and a war results, the threat of nuclear strikes, and possibly the strikes themselves, will be a major part of his strategy for victory.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Schneider","given":"Mark B."}],"container-title":"Comparative Strategy","DOI":"10.1080/01495933.2018.1526558","ISSN":"0149-5933","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,10,20]]},"page":"361-372","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Russian nuclear “de-escalation” of future war","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/01495933.2018.1526558","volume":"37"},
  {"id":"schram_betterlivinghassling_2019","abstract":"Russian support for rebels in Eastern Ukraine, cyberattacks like the Stuxnet\nvirus against the Iranian nuclear program, China's expansion in the South China Sea, and many other examples demonstrate that grey zone conflict, or political conflict falling short of war, is a pervasive feature of the international order. However, this phenomena has received little formal attention. This paper identifies a specific type of grey zone conflict, hassling, where one side commits costly violence against the other to extract a larger share of a political settlement. This paper then develops a series of models describing this phenomena. Model 1 shows\nthat a state's inability to commit to not hassle can lead to hassling occurring in\nequilibrium, despite the existence of a mutually beneficial peaceful offer. Model\n2 demonstrates that uncertainty over how states value hassling can lead to war. Model 3 provides a game-free analysis of hassling models with information asymmetry and speaks to the conditions under which hassling is more likely to occur.

These activities have been viewed as destabilizing by both academics and policy makers, as miscalculations or missteps in conducting low-level operations can risk escalation to war. I show the opposite can be true: these operations can prevent escalation to a greater war. I examine a type of low-level conflict that I call “hassling” in the common framework of bargaining and war. The critical feature of hassling is that it weakens a targeted state. I find that when a rising power rules out peaceful bargains, hassling the rising power can prevent a preventive war, with efficiency gains for the involved states. This intuition is formalized in a dynamic model of conflict and is explored through examinations of Israel's Operation Outside the Box (2007), the United States' involvement in Iraq (1991–2003), and Russia's operations in Ukraine (beginning in 2014).","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Schram","given":"Peter"}],"container-title":"American Journal of Political Science","DOI":"10.1111/ajps.12538","ISSN":"1540-5907","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,24]]},"language":"en","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Hassling: How States Prevent a Preventive War","title-short":"Hassling","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajps.12538"},
  {"id":"schrodt_sevendeadlysins_2014","abstract":"A combination of technological change, methodological drift and a certain degree of intellectual sloth, particularly with respect to philosophy of science, has allowed contemporary quantitative political analysis to accumulate a series of dysfunctional habits that have rendered much of contemporary research more or less meaningless. I identify these ‘seven deadly sins’ as: Garbage can models that ignore the effects of collinearity; Pre-scientific explanation in the absence of prediction; Excessive reanalysis of a small number of datasets; Using complex methods without understanding the underlying assumptions; Interpreting frequentist statistics as if they were Bayesian; A linear statistical monoculture that fails to consider alternative structures; Confusing statistical controls and experimental controls. The answer to these problems is not to abandon quantitative approaches, but rather engage in solid, thoughtful, original work driven by an appreciation of both theory and data.

  {"id":"schultz_enforcementproblemcoercive_2010","abstract":"This article explores the strategic problems that arise when a state seeks to use military force to compel changes in another state's policies. Although the costs associated with military action mean that there generally exist compromises that both sides prefer to conflict, bargaining may fail if such deals are not enforceable in the face of temptations to renege on policy concessions. This study develops a model that shows that inefficient conflict can occur when states bargain over policies that one of them can change unilaterally and covertly. I then show that this theory is useful for understanding a common source of international conflict: conflicts that arise when one state supports rebel groups engaged in a civil war with another state.Episodes of rebel support are associated with a substantial increase in the risk of interstate militarized disputes, the lethality of these disputes, and the likelihood of repeated violence. Agreements to limit rebel support are unlikely to reduce interstate violence unless they are coupled with concessions by the target state and/or monitoring mechanisms, both of which are shown theoretically to mitigate the enforcement problem.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,2,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Schultz","given":"Kenneth A."}],"container-title":"International Organization","ISSN":"0020-8183","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"page":"281-312","source":"JSTOR","title":"The Enforcement Problem in Coercive Bargaining: Interstate Conflict over Rebel Support in Civil Wars","title-short":"The Enforcement Problem in Coercive Bargaining","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/40608016","volume":"64"},

  {"id":"sechser_goliathcursecoercive_2010","abstract":"AbstractStates typically issue compellent threats against considerably weaker adversaries, yet their threats often fail. Why? Expanding on a standard model of international crisis bargaining, I argue that a theory of reputation-building can help shed light on this puzzle. The model casts reputation as a strategic problem, showing that challengers issuing compellent threats have incentives to anticipate the reputation costs that target states incur when appeasing aggressors. If challengers can recognize these costs and offset them with side payments or smaller demands, then even reputation-conscious targets will acquiesce. I argue, however, that military strength contributes to information problems that make challengers more likely to underestimate their targets' reputation costs and insufficiently compensate them. In this way, military power can undermine the effectiveness of compellent threats. The logic is illustrated by the 1939 Russo-Finnish crisis, and the argument's implications for the study of coercive diplomacy are explored.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,9,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Sechser","given":"Todd S."}],"container-title":"International Organization","DOI":"10.1017/S0020818310000214","ISSN":"1531-5088, 0020-8183","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,10]]},"page":"627-660","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Goliath's Curse: Coercive Threats and Asymmetric Power","title-short":"Goliath's Curse","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-organization/article/goliaths-curse-coercive-threats-and-asymmetric-power/EE40FA5B9C018D5DE86812AD70BFBEA8","volume":"64"},

Do the tools groups use to monitor their operatives and enforce discipline create security vulnerabilities that governments can exploit? The Terrorist's Dilemma is the first book to systematically examine the great variation in how terrorist groups are structured. Employing a broad range of agency theory, historical case studies, and terrorists' own internal documents, Jacob Shapiro provocatively discusses the core managerial challenges that terrorists face and illustrates how their political goals interact with the operational environment to push them to organize in particular ways. Shapiro provides a historically informed explanation for why some groups have little hierarchy, while others resemble miniature firms, complete with line charts and written disciplinary codes. Looking at groups in Africa, Asia, Europe, and North America, he highlights how consistent and widespread the terrorist's dilemma--balancing the desire to maintain control with the need for secrecy--has been since the 1880s. Through an analysis of more than a hundred terrorist autobiographies he shows how prevalent bureaucracy has been, and he utilizes a cache of internal documents from al-Qa'ida in Iraq to outline why this deadly group used so much paperwork to handle its people. Tracing the strategic interaction between terrorist leaders and their operatives, Shapiro closes with a series of comparative case studies, indicating that the differences in how groups in the same conflict approach their dilemmas are consistent with an agency theory perspective.  The Terrorist's Dilemma demonstrates the management constraints inherent to terrorist groups and sheds light on specific organizational details that can be exploited to more efficiently combat terrorist activity.","author":[{"family":"Shapiro","given":"Jacob N."}],"ISBN":"978-1-4008-4864-5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,8,4]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"351","publisher":"Princeton University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"The Terrorist's Dilemma: Managing Violent Covert Organizations","title-short":"The Terrorist's Dilemma","type":"book"},

Drawing on that experience, and on a range of revealing case studies ranging from Nepal to Borneo, War From The Ground Up offers a distinctive perspective on contemporary armed conflict: while most accounts of war look down at the battlefield from an academic perspective, or across it as a personal narrative, the author looks up from the battlefield to consider the concepts that put him there, and how they played out on the ground. Simpson argues that in the Afghan conflict, and in contemporary conflicts more generally, liberal powers and their armed forces have blurred the line between military and political activity. More broadly, they have challenged the distinction between war and peace. He contends that this loss of clarity is more a response to the conditions of combat in the early wenty-first century, particularly that of globalisation, than a deliberate choice. The issue is thus not whether the West should engage in such practices, but how to manage, gain advantage from, and mitigate the risks of this evolution in warfare. War From The Ground Up draws on personal experience from the frontline, situated in relation to historical context and strategic thought, to offer a reevaluation of the concept of war in contemporary conflict.

Sweeping claims about the offense-defense balance in cyberspace are misguided because the balance can be assessed only with respect to specific organizational skills and technologies. The balance is defined in dyadic terms, that is, the value less the costs of offensive operations and the value less the costs of defensive operations. The costs of cyber operations are shaped primarily by the organizational skills needed to create and manage complex information technology efficiently. The current success of offense results primarily from poor defensive management and the relatively simpler goals of offense; it can be very costly to exert precise physical effects using cyberweapons. An empirical analysis shows that the Stuxnet cyberattacks on Iran's nuclear facilities very likely cost the offense much more than the defense. The perceived benefits of both the Stuxnet offense and defense, moreover, were likely two orders of magnitude greater than the perceived costs, making it unlikely that decisionmakers focused on costs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,10,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Slayton","given":"Rebecca"}],"container-title":"International Security","container-title-short":"International Security","DOI":"10.1162/ISEC_a_00267","ISSN":"0162-2889","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,1,1]]},"page":"72-109","source":"mitpressjournals.org (Atypon)","title":"What Is the Cyber Offense-Defense Balance?

  {"id":"sobek_memyselfallies_2013","abstract":"As far back as Thucydides, scholars have hypothesized that power affects the onset of conflict. Despite its importance, power remains a difficult concept to measure, and scholars have primarily relied on material measures that quantify the internal resources available to a state. This concentration on internal sources of power, however, excludes an important power resource available to a state: its external relations. It is reasonable to expect that when a state estimates the power of a potential opponent it looks not only at the internal resources but also at the power of states that would likely join the conflict. In this article, we develop a new measure of external power that explicitly accounts for the external sources of state power. Unlike previous studies that aggregate a state’s expected alliance contributions, our measure is based on the expected contribution of all states, allies and non-allies alike. We conduct a preliminary test of this new measure on dispute onset, and our results provide support for power preponderance over balance of power theories. External power parity contributes to dispute onset rather than deterrence. In addition, we show that examining the combined, rather than individual, effects of external and internal power produces some intriguing results, suggesting that one state’s internal power preponderance can be offset by another state’s preponderance of external power. These results altogether suggest that further studies examining the role of external power can produce fruitful results.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,4,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Sobek","given":"David"},{"family":"Clare","given":"Joe"}],"container-title":"Journal of Peace Research","container-title-short":"Journal of Peace Research","DOI":"10.1177/0022343313484047","ISSN":"0022-3433","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"469-478","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Me, myself, and allies: Understanding the external sources of power","title-short":"Me, myself, and allies","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0022343313484047","volume":"50"},
  {"id":"sowell_findingordercontentious_2015","abstract":"This inquiry started with the simple question, \"Who manages the Internet infrastructure and how?\" Since, this question evolved into an evaluation of the routing system and the institutions that manage it. This institutional complex is referred to as the number resource system (NRS). NRS authority is contingent, rooted in consensus based knowledge assessment necessary to adapt apace with Internet growth. The efficiency with which observable negative externalities are remediated is a compelling entry point to this work. The Pakistan-YouTube story is a halcyon parable of \"self-repair.\" Network operators recognized a global negative externality, traced it to the origin, and remediated the complicit networks in approximately three hours. To the casual observer, organic cooperation surfaced to remediate damages, then dissolved into the background noise of \"normal operations.\" Remediation is far from organic; rather, it is a consequence of distinct rights and obligations amongst, and enforced by, NRS participants. Explaining the rationale and mechanics of \"ad hoc\" crisis management is the first contribution of this work. The early NRS comprised \"close-knit yet loosely organized\" communities created to 1) share operational knowledge (network operator groups, NOGs); 2) delegate unique network identifiers (Regional Internet Registries, RIRs); 3) create neutral markets for exchanging routes and traffic (Internet eXchanges, IXes); and 4) limit abusive messaging (anti-spam, later anti-abuse). Alongside Internet growth, NRS norms evolved into distinct institutions, replete with function-specific constitutional, collective choice, and operational rules for managing the knowledge commons and facilities supporting routing system function. The NRS institutions form a contingent social order, rooted in shared, authoritative images of system function and externalities management. NRS institutions collectively ensure participants common interests in the jointly provisioned routing system stability. The second contribution of this work explains NRS institutional structures and how the attendant rules keep pace with a high clockspeed Internet infrastructure. NRS institutions are characteristically, and necessarily, adaptive: each comprises a unique consensus process, animated by a diverse set of nominal competitors, that creates and adapts function-specific rules and processes contributing to routing system integrity. Consensus processes evaluate the performance of common resource management rules and, when-not if-necessary, adapt these rules to satisfy changing resource demands and patterns of use in the broader Internet infrastructure industry. Anticipation and evaluation in the consensus process are essential to adaptive capability, framed as a form of joint knowledge assessment. Moreover, diverse representation, comprising experts across industry sub-sectors, animated by constructive conflict amongst these experts, mediated by consensus processes, makes for a durable family of credible knowledge assessment processes that are rare amongst conventional regulatory arrangements. Processes described thus far are largely endogenous to the NRS and its constituencies. Historically these institutions have operated quietly underneath the hood. Adaptation and the resulting policy is scoped to common interests, explicitly avoiding impinging on public policy. In contrast to conventional international regimes, the NRS self-limits to the scope of its authority, namely supporting and enhancing routing system function. Thus far, the NRS's common interests have not run counter to the public interest. Nonetheless, a path-dependent history of harmonious alignment between a common and the public does not carry the assurances of alignment resulting from explicit coordination and cooperation. Some states and state-sanctioned international governance organizations see control of NRS facilities as critical to preserving their own authority. Predatory claims to stewardship of routing system resources further complicates the alignment problem. To better frame and understand this alignment problem, the concluding chapters of the dissertation explore the question: 'Are the incentives and resources of NRS institutions commensurate with the aggregate social loss due to a partial, or worse yet, systemic, failure?\" Simply put, absent the progress on the explicit assurances above, the answer is no. Would-be state principals also fall short. State-based authorities are severely deficient in basic operational capacity that form the foundation of knowledge assessment capabilities and subsequent adaptive capabilities in the NRS. States' deficiencies correspond to those capabilities engendered by the NRS. Adding NRS stewardship to a state's portfolio of domestic regulatory interests will expose management processes to powerful short-term interests that will inevitably weaken, if not eliminate, extant credible knowledge assessment and adaptive capabilities. In effect, aggressive predatory rule would likely eliminate precisely the characteristics that make the NRS a valuable steward of a high clockspeed infrastructure. This initial conclusion is not a prediction of adaptive management doomed to failure. Although neither the NRS, nor state authorities, have sufficient capabilities and modes of authority to manage an Internet underpinning an ever-increasing array of public, private, and social goods on their own, a mix of their capabilities is sufficient. Rather, the conclusion frames a discussion of what explicit assurances will look like and the barriers to developing those assurances. The last part of this dissertation lays out the challenges for establishing such a comity, a mutual recognition of the norms and authority between the NRS and state authorities. In the global political arena, the NRS's political capital is credible knowledge assessment and adaptive capacity as the roots of authoritative policy advice. Barriers to explicit assurances draw lessons from the deconstruction and reconstruction of scientific knowledge in political environments, instances of international epistemic consensus, and characteristics of elusive, but effective, adaptation that has survived in conventional regulatory environments. Analytically, the dissertation argues the NRS and state authority need not be competitors-the two can be quite complementary. If these two sets of institutions can avoid the pitfalls of previous efforts, in particular short-term usurpation of the others' authority, the global, nondiscriminatory character of the Internet may be sustainable.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Sowell","given":"Jesse H."}],"genre":"Thesis","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology","source":"dspace.mit.edu","title":"Finding order in a contentious Internet","type":"thesis","URL":"http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/97324"},

  {"id":"spaniel_crediblecommitmentcovert_2018","abstract":"A recurring challenge in politics is to convince actors to take cooperative actions against their self-interest. This is especially challenging for executives conducting covert activities, as infractions are unobservable and institutional reforms often require the executive's consent. We develop a model based in the auditing literature to investigate when executives agree to reforms that credibly constrain their behaviors. If the revelation cost falls in a high range, the risk of whistleblowing convinces executives to restrain themselves. Executives cannot credibly commit to this when the costs are low, resulting in inefficient investigations from watchdog groups that tax executive resources. We show that executives are sometimes better off in the first case than the second, which results in executives endogenously reforming institutions to achieve this outcome. We illustrate the mechanism with a case study of Gerald Ford's executive reforms to the intelligence community in the 1970s.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,5,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Spaniel","given":"William"},{"family":"Poznansky","given":"Michael"}],"container-title":"American Journal of Political Science","DOI":"10.1111/ajps.12363","ISSN":"1540-5907","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"en","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Credible Commitment in Covert Affairs","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajps.12363","volume":"0"},
  {"id":"staniland_networksrebellionexplaining_2014","abstract":"The organizational cohesion of insurgent groups is central to explaining patterns of violence, the effectiveness of counterinsurgency, and civil war outcomes. Cohesive insurgent groups produce more effective war-fighting forces and are more credible negotiators; organizational cohesion shapes both the duration of wars and their ultimate resolution. In Networks of Rebellion, Paul Staniland explains why insurgent leaders differ so radically in their ability to build strong organizations and why the cohesion of armed groups changes over time during conflicts. He outlines a new way of thinking about the sources and structure of insurgent groups, distinguishing among integrated, vanguard, parochial, and fragmented groups.  Staniland compares insurgent groups, their differing social bases, and how the nature of the coalitions and networks within which these armed groups were built has determined their discipline and internal control. He examines insurgent groups in Afghanistan, 1975 to the present day, Kashmir (1988–2003), Sri Lanka from the 1970s to the defeat of the Tamil Tigers in 2009, and several communist uprisings in Southeast Asia during the Cold War. The initial organization of an insurgent group depends on the position of its leaders in prewar political networks. These social bases shape what leaders can and cannot do when they build a new insurgent group. Counterinsurgency, insurgent strategy, and international intervention can cause organizational change. During war, insurgent groups are embedded in social ties that determine they how they organize, fight, and negotiate; as these ties shift, organizational structure changes as well.","author":[{"family":"Staniland","given":"Paul"}],"ISBN":"978-0-8014-7929-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"313","publisher":"Cornell University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Networks of Rebellion: Explaining Insurgent Cohesion and Collapse","title-short":"Networks of Rebellion","type":"book"},

This fascinating mix of conflict and cooperation shapes patterns of politics, governance, and violence. Building on recent findings about state formation, I offer a conceptual typology of political orders amidst civil war. Wartime political orders vary according to the distribution of territorial control and the level of cooperation between states and insurgents. Orders range from collusion and shared sovereignty to spheres of influence and tacit coexistence to clashing monopolies and guerrilla disorder. Examples from contemporary South Asian conflicts illustrate these concepts, which are scalable and portable across contexts. Scholars need to think more creatively about the politicalmilitary arrangements that emerge and evolve during war. A key policy implication is that there are many ways of forging stability without creating a counterinsurgent Leviathan.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,14]]},"archive":"JSTOR","author":[{"family":"Staniland","given":"Paul"}],"container-title":"Perspectives on Politics","ISSN":"1537-5927","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"page":"243-264","source":"JSTOR","title":"States, Insurgents, and Wartime Political Orders","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/41479550","volume":"10"},

I evaluate the empirical implications of this theory against the historical record provided by the universe of major power military interventions since World War II.

In early 2015, General-Lieutenant A. V. Kartapolov, then director of the Russian General Staff’s Main Operation’s Directorate, both explained the concept in an article written for the Journal of the Academy of Military Science and provided a schematic visualization of the concept. Before this revelation, Western analysts had thought that the Russian military was using either hybrid warfare concepts or new-generation warfare (NGW) means. In response to these assertions from the West, Russian military officers stated that they do not conduct hybrid war, noting clearly that this is a Western method for waging modern war. However, two retired Russian officers did write extensively on NGW in 2012 and 2013, which prompted much discussion in the West. This concept was not directly refuted by Russian military officers, which may mean it is still a relevant way to consider warfare within the ranks of military professionals. At this moment, however, with General Staff backing, it appears that the new-type warfare concept has won out over NGW, although an evolution and integration of thinking is also apparent in the progression from hybrid, to NGW, to new-type warfare.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,10,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Thomas","given":"Timothy"}],"container-title":"The Journal of Slavic Military Studies","DOI":"10.1080/13518046.2016.1232541","ISSN":"1351-8046","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,10,1]]},"page":"554-575","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"The Evolution of Russian Military Thought: Integrating Hybrid, New-Generation, and New-Type Thinking","title-short":"The Evolution of Russian Military Thought","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13518046.2016.1232541","volume":"29"},

Examination of the cyclical fluctuations in the concentration of sea power and land power over the past 500 years help illustrate this general point.

Ucko also suggests how the military can better prepare for the unique challenges of modern warfare, where it is charged with everything from providing security to supporting reconstruction to establishing basic governance—all while stabilizing conquered territory and engaging with local populations. After briefly surveying the history of American counterinsurgency operations, Ucko focuses on measures the military has taken since 2001 to relearn old lessons about counterinsurgency, to improve its ability to conduct stability operations, to change the institutional bias against counterinsurgency, and to account for successes gained from the learning process.Given the effectiveness of insurgent tactics, the frequency of operations aimed at building local capacity, and the danger of ungoverned spaces acting as havens for hostile groups, the military must acquire new skills to confront irregular threats in future wars.

  {"id":"valeriano_dynamicscyberconflict_2014","abstract":"Much discussion of the concept of cyberwar, cyber conflict, and the changing dynamic of future security interactions is founded upon the study of what could be, conjured through spectacular flights of the imagination. The goal of this research article is to exhaustively collect information on cyber interactions between rival states in the last decade so that we can delineate the patterns of cyber conflict as reflected by evidence at the international level. The field of cyber security needs a clear return to social science in order to be able to definitively engage the cyber debate with facts, figures, and theory. To that end we provide a dataset of cyber incidents and cyber disputes that spans from 2001 to 2011. Our data include 110 cyber incidents and 45 cyber disputes. Further, we test our theory of cyber conflict which argues that restraint and regionalism should be expected, counter-intuitive to conventional wisdom. We find here that the actual magnitude and pace of cyber disputes among rivals does not match with popular perception; 20 of 126 active rivals engaged in cyber conflict. The interactions that are uncovered are limited in terms of magnitude and frequency suggesting cyber restraint. Further, most of the cyber disputes that are uncovered are regional in tone, defying the unbounded nature of cyberpower. The coming era of cyber conflict may continue to exhibit these patterns despite fears mentioned in the discourse by the media and cyber security professionals.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,12,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Valeriano","given":"Brandon"},{"family":"Maness","given":"Ryan C"}],"container-title":"Journal of Peace Research","container-title-short":"Journal of Peace Research","DOI":"10.1177/0022343313518940","ISSN":"0022-3433","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"347-360","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"The dynamics of cyber conflict between rival antagonists, 2001–11","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0022343313518940","volume":"51"},

Thus to explain why wars occur one must explain why states must fight before reaching agreement, which implies that war must be considered part of the bargaining process that leads to a negotiated settlement and not as an alternative to it. However, most attempts to explain the occurrence of war assume that it is entirely the result of a choice made before it begins. I show that this way of posing the problem can only lead to misleading conclusions by analyzing a model in which a negotiated settlement remains possible after war starts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,8,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Wagner","given":"R.

The dataset is coded according to both the Correlates of War and the Gleditsch and Ward (1999) state lists, and is therefore compatible with a great number of existing databases in the discipline. Provided in a geographic data format, CShapes can be used directly with standard GIS software, allowing a wide range of spatial computations. In addition, we supply a CShapes package for the R statistical toolkit. This package enables researchers without GIS skills to perform various useful operations on the GIS maps. The paper introduces the CShapes dataset and structure and gives three examples of how to use CShapes in political science research. First, we show how results from quantitative analysis can be depicted intuitively as a map. The second application gives an example of computing indicators on the CShapes maps, which can then be used in statistical tests. Third, we illustrate the use of CShapes for generating different weights matrices in spatial statistical applications. All the examples can be replicated using the freely available R package and do not require specialized GIS skills.

  {"id":"wilson_keynesgoesnuclear_2019","abstract":"Among the most important ideas in Cold War nuclear strategy and arms control was that of “stability”—the notion that by protecting weapons for use in retaliation, the superpowers would be less likely to fight a thermonuclear war. Conventional wisdom among strategists and historians of strategy has long held that stability was inherent to the logic of rational nuclear deterrence. This essay shows the conventional wisdom to be mistaken. It examines the technical practice of Thomas Schelling, who introduced the stability idea in a classic 1958 paper. Celebrated as a game theorist, Schelling was actually trained as a Keynesian macroeconomic modeler during the second half of the 1940s. In 1958, he used Keynesian techniques to frame deterrence as a stable system of dynamic adjustment, akin to the stable macroeconomic system he had modeled as a young economist. Among Schelling's fellow strategists, stability quickly became popular as a rationalization for their preferred nuclear deployment policies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Wilson","given":"Benjamin"}],"container-title":"Modern Intellectual History","DOI":"10.1017/S1479244319000271","ISSN":"1479-2443, 1479-2451","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,9]]},"language":"en","page":"1-31","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Keynes Goes Nuclear: Thomas Schelling and the Macroeconomic Origins of Strategic Stability","title-short":"Keynes Goes Nuclear","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/modern-intellectual-history/article/keynes-goes-nuclear-thomas-schelling-and-the-macroeconomic-origins-of-strategic-stability/697C35BC8A5358FB4AC56BCDB4C126D3"},

Despite their widespread popularity, both hands-tying and sunk-cost signaling have come under criticism, and there’s little direct evidence that leaders understand costly signals the way our models tell us they should. We present evidence from a survey experiment fielded on a unique sample of elite decision makers from the Israeli Knesset. We find that both types of costly signaling are effective in shaping assessments of resolve for both leaders and the public. However, although theories of signaling tend to assume homogenous audiences, we show that leaders vary significantly in how credible they perceive signals to be, depending on their foreign policy dispositions, rather than their levels of military or political experience. Our results thus encourage international relations scholars to more fully bring heterogeneous recipients into our theories of signaling and point to the important role of dispositional orientations for the study of leaders.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Yarhi-Milo","given":"Keren"},{"family":"Kertzer","given":"Joshua D."},{"family":"Renshon","given":"Jonathan"}],"container-title":"Journal of Conflict Resolution","container-title-short":"Journal of Conflict Resolution","DOI":"10.1177/0022002718785693","ISSN":"0022-0027","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"2150-2179","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Tying Hands, Sinking Costs, and Leader Attributes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0022002718785693","volume":"62"},

Rather than focusing on a leader's background, beliefs, bargaining skills, or biases, Yarhi-Milo draws a systematic link between a trait called self-monitoring and foreign policy behavior. She examines self-monitoring among national leaders and advisers and shows that while high self-monitors modify their behavior strategically to cultivate image-enhancing status, low self-monitors are less likely to change their behavior in response to reputation concerns.Exploring self-monitoring through case studies of foreign policy crises during the terms of U.S. presidents Carter, Reagan, and Clinton, Yarhi-Milo disproves the notion that hawks are always more likely than doves to fight for reputation. Instead, Yarhi-Milo demonstrates that a decision maker's propensity for impression management is directly associated with the use of force to restore a reputation for resolve on the international stage.Who Fights for Reputation offers a brand-new understanding of the pivotal influence that psychological factors have on political leadership, military engagement, and the protection of public prestige.","author":[{"family":"Yarhi-Milo","given":"Keren"}],"ISBN":"978-0-691-18128-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,11]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"376","publisher":"Princeton University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Who Fights for Reputation: The Psychology of Leaders in International Conflict","title-short":"Who Fights for Reputation","type":"book"},

The paradigm's origins are traced to Realist political thought and balance of power politics.

Structural (or Neorealist) Deterrence Theory sees the key to international stability in the distribution of power within the system in general, and among the great powers in particular. By contrast, Decision‐Theoretic Deterrence Theory focuses upon the interplay of outcomes, preferences and rational choices in determining interstate conflict behavior. The critical deductions of both strands of the theory are at odds with the empirical record and each is hard put to explain the stability of the post—war period.

By contrast, proponents of the spiral model claim that the prescriptions associated with deterrence theory frequently lead to vicious cycles of reciprocated conflict., According to Jervis `both sets of theorists fail to discuss the conditions under which their theories will not apply'. In this article we do just that, identifying and comparing the conditions associated with conflict spirals and with crisis stability, in the context of a game-theoretic escalation model with incomplete information.

China is curiously selective in its timing, targets, and tools of coercion: China rarely employs military coercion, and it does not coerce all countries that pose similar threats. An examination of newly available primary documents and hundreds of hours of interviews with Chinese officials to trace the decisionmaking processes behind China's use and nonuse of coercion reveals a new theory of when, why, and how China employs coercion against other states, especially in the South China Sea. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the findings show that China is a cautious bully that does not use coercion frequently. In addition, when China becomes stronger, it tends to use military coercion less often, choosing instead nonmilitary tools. Moreover, concerns with its reputation for resolve and with economic cost are critical elements of Chinese decisionmaking regarding the costs and benefits of coercing its neighbors. China often coerces one target to deter others—“killing the chicken to scare the monkey.” These findings have important implications for how scholars understand states' coercive strategies and the future of Chinese behavior in the region and beyond.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Ketian"}],"container-title":"International Security","container-title-short":"International Security","DOI":"10.1162/isec_a_00354","ISSN":"0162-2889","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,1]]},"page":"117-159","source":"MIT Press Journals","title":"Cautious Bully: Reputation, Resolve, and Beijing's Use of Coercion in the South China Sea","title-short":"Cautious Bully","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1162/isec_a_00354","volume":"44"},
