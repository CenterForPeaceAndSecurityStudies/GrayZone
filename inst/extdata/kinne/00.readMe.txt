## These files replicate the analysis in Kinne, Brandon J. 2018. “Defense
## Cooperation Agreements and the Emergence of a Global Security Network,”
## International Organization.

## The models are estimated in Stata, which has better facilities for
## TSCS and panel data. (Specifically, the models were estimated in Stata/MP
## 14.2.) The Stata .do file exports the results to raw text files. An
## accompanying R script conducts post-regression analyses and plots figures.
##
## The files should be executed in the order in which they appear. I.e.,
## first run the file “01.mainEstimates.do” in Stata. Then run the
## “02.mainFigures.R” file in R. Note that the R script requires a relatively
## large number of packages. Generally, the code should be compatible
## with the most recent versions of the required packages. However, some
## packages (e.g., ggplot2) frequently incorporate version updates that
## render previous code obsolete. Thus, portions of the code may require
## tweaking, depending on how far into the future you are.
## 
## The additional appendix files replicate the results from the online
## appendix. The first file, “03.appendixEstimates1.do”, employs the
## same logit models as in the main paper, with alternative model
## specifications. These results appear as Tables 3-6 in the appendix. The
## second file, “04.appendixEstimates2.R”, implements two separate
## inferential network models (i.e., the TERGM and the SAOM). These
## results appear as Tables 1-2 in the appendix. Note that the inferential
## network models may take anywhere from a few hours to a few days to
## estimate, depending on your hardware. Note as well that because these
## models employ stochastic estimation algorithms, the replication may not
## yield the *exact* parameter estimates as displayed in the online appendix.
## However, any differences should be minuscule and should not affect signs
## or significance.
